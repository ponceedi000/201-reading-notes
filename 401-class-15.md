## Readings: Implementation: Trees

### [Trees](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-15/resources/Trees.html)

- Common Terminology?
  * Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain itâ€™s own values, and references to other nodes
  * Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
  * K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, `k = 2`.
  * Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
  * Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
  * Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
  * Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
  * Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

- What do tree look like if you could visualize it?

- Traversals: There are 2 categories of traversals when using trees
  * **Depth First**
    * This is where we prioritize traversing through the height of the tree first
    * Pre-order: `root >> left >> right`
    * In-order: `left >> root >> right`
    * Post-order: `left >> right >> root`
  * **Breadth First***
    * Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node. 

- Binary Tree Vs K-ary Trees
  * > Trees can have any number of children per node, but Binary Trees restrict the number of children to two (hence our left and right children).
  * Binary Tree have no specific sorting order.
  * We can add nodes to a binary tree as long as we have space for it.
