### [List Comprehensions](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/list-comprehensions-in-python)

- Syntax example:
`my_new_list = [ expression for item in list ]`
  1. First is the expression weâ€™d like to carry out. expression inside the square brackets.
  2. Second is the object that the expression will work on. item inside the square brackets.
  3. Finally, we need an iterable list of objects to build our new list from. list inside the square brackets.

- What are list comprehensions?
> "What are list comprehensions in Python?
List comprehensions are used for creating new lists from other iterables like tuples, strings, arrays, lists, etc. A list comprehension consists of brackets containing the expression, which is executed for each element along with the for loop to iterate over each element." - [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-list-comprehension/)
- Side notes:
  * List comprehensions methods are much cleaner way to create and manage lists.
  * List comprehensions are a much more compact way of creating lists.
  * List comprehensions can be more flexible than for loops and usually much more faster too.
- Creating a list with list comprehensions:
```
# construct a basic list using range() and list comprehensions
# syntax
# [ expression for item in list ]
digits = [x for x in range(10)]

print(digits)
```
Output: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`

- Using functions in list comprehensions such that we create and are not built-in from python:
```
# list comprehension with functions
# create a function that returns a number doubled
def double(x):
    return x*2

nums = [double(x) for x in range(1,10)]
print(nums)
```
Output: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]`

- Summary: There many differnt ways we can utilize list comprehensions to write cleaner Python code. Compact code is essential in the real world because it saves time and can improve productivity.
- Having clean code is not only beneficial for your teamates who have to access your code but also great for yourself when you take a break from your code and have to come back 'fresh'.
- The end goal here is to have more manageable code.
