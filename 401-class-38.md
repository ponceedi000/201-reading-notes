### [Conditional Rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)

- **What is conditional rendering?**
 * Conditional rendering is a term to describe the ability to render different user interface (UI) markup if a condition is true or false. In React, it allows us to render different elements or components based on a condition
 * conditional rendering works the same way that conditions works in JavaScript.
 * > Use JavaScript operators like `if` or the `conditional operator` to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.
- **Element Variables**
  * As we all know, you use variables to store elements. This helps conditionally render a part of the component while the rest of the output does not change.
  * EX: at [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/QKzAgB?editors=0010)
- **Inline If with Logical && Operator**
  * You may embed expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces. This includes the JavaScript logical && operator
  * EX: This works because in JS, `true && expression` always evaluates to `express`, and `false && expression` always evaluates to `false`
```
function Mailbox(props) {
  const unreadMessages = props.unreadMessages;
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      {unreadMessages.length > 0 &&
        <h2>
          You have {unreadMessages.length} unread messages.
        </h2>
      }
    </div>
  );
}
```
- **Inline If-Else with Conditional Operator**
  * > Another method for conditionally rendering elements inline is to use the JavaScript `conditional operator condition ? true : false`.

```
render() {
  const isLoggedIn = this.state.isLoggedIn;
  return (
    <div>
      The user is <b>{isLoggedIn ? 'currently' : 'not'}</b> logged in.
    </div>
  );
}
```

- **Preventing Component from Rendering**
  * In a rare situation that you want a component to hide itself even though it was rendered by another component, return `null` instead of its rendered output.
  * *Returning null from a component’s render method does not affect the firing of the component’s lifecycle methods.
  *

### [React - Lists & Keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)

- **Transforming a list in JavaScript**
  * The `map()` function takes an array of numbers and double their values. In the below ex,we assign the new array returned by map() to the variable named `doubled` and log it:
```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);
console.log(doubled);
```
- **Rendering Multiple Components**
  * You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX by simply using curly braces `{}`
  * Belows ex loops through number array(using `map()`) and returns list element for each item (assigning the resulting array to `listItems`):
```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
  <li>{number}</li>
);
```
- **Basic List Component**
  * It typically standard practice to render lists inside of a component
  * To do this, we can refactor the above code into a component that accepts an array of `numbers` and then outputs a list of elements:
```
function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    <li>{number}</li>
  );
  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<NumberList numbers={numbers} />);
```
*Disclaimer*: Running the above code will give you a warning about a key that needs to be provided (Key: a special string attribute that needs to be included when creating a list of elements: `<li key={number.toString()}> {number}</li>`

- **Keys**
  * > Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity
  * Pick a key to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. Best practice is to use IDs from your data as keys:
```const todoItems = todos.map((todo) =>
  <li key={todo.id}>
    {todo.text}
  </li>
);
```
- **Extracting Components with Keys**
  * A good rule of thumb is that elements inside the map() call need keys.
```
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    // Correct! Key should be specified inside the array.
    <ListItem key={number.toString()} value={number} />
  );
```
- **Embedding map() in JSX**
  * > JSX allows embedding any expression in curly braces so we could inline the `map()` result
  * Sometimes this results in clearer code, but this style can also be abused. Like in JavaScript, it is up to you to decide whether it is worth extracting a variable for readability. Keep in mind that if the map() body is too nested, it might be a good time to extract a component.
```
function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  return (
    <ul>
      {numbers.map((number) =>
        <ListItem key={number.toString()}
                  value={number} />
      )}
    </ul>
  );
}
```
