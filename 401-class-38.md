### [Conditional Rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)

- **What is conditional rendering?**
 * Conditional rendering is a term to describe the ability to render different user interface (UI) markup if a condition is true or false. In React, it allows us to render different elements or components based on a condition
 * conditional rendering works the same way that conditions works in JavaScript.
 * > Use JavaScript operators like `if` or the `conditional operator` to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.
- **Element Variables**
  * As we all know, you use variables to store elements. This helps conditionally render a part of the component while the rest of the output does not change.
  * EX: at [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/QKzAgB?editors=0010)
- **Inline If with Logical && Operator**
  * You may embed expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces. This includes the JavaScript logical && operator
  * EX: This works because in JS, `true && expression` always evaluates to `express`, and `false && expression` always evaluates to `false`
```
function Mailbox(props) {
  const unreadMessages = props.unreadMessages;
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      {unreadMessages.length > 0 &&
        <h2>
          You have {unreadMessages.length} unread messages.
        </h2>
      }
    </div>
  );
}
```
- **Inline If-Else with Conditional Operator**
  * > Another method for conditionally rendering elements inline is to use the JavaScript `conditional operator condition ? true : false`.

```
render() {
  const isLoggedIn = this.state.isLoggedIn;
  return (
    <div>
      The user is <b>{isLoggedIn ? 'currently' : 'not'}</b> logged in.
    </div>
  );
}
```

- **Preventing Component from Rendering**
  * In a rare situation that you want a component to hide itself even though it was rendered by another component, return `null` instead of its rendered output.
  * *Returning null from a component’s render method does not affect the firing of the component’s lifecycle methods.
  *
