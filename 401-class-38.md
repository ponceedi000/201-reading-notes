### [Conditional Rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)

- **What is conditional rendering?**
 * Conditional rendering is a term to describe the ability to render different user interface (UI) markup if a condition is true or false. In React, it allows us to render different elements or components based on a condition
 * conditional rendering works the same way that conditions works in JavaScript.
 * > Use JavaScript operators like `if` or the `conditional operator` to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.
- **Element Variables**
  * As we all know, you use variables to store elements. This helps conditionally render a part of the component while the rest of the output does not change.
  * EX: at [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/QKzAgB?editors=0010)
- **Inline If with Logical && Operator**
  * You may embed expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces. This includes the JavaScript logical && operator
  * EX: This works because in JS, `true && expression` always evaluates to `express`, and `false && expression` always evaluates to `false`
```
function Mailbox(props) {
  const unreadMessages = props.unreadMessages;
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      {unreadMessages.length > 0 &&
        <h2>
          You have {unreadMessages.length} unread messages.
        </h2>
      }
    </div>
  );
}
```
- **Inline If-Else with Conditional Operator**
  * > Another method for conditionally rendering elements inline is to use the JavaScript `conditional operator condition ? true : false`.

```
render() {
  const isLoggedIn = this.state.isLoggedIn;
  return (
    <div>
      The user is <b>{isLoggedIn ? 'currently' : 'not'}</b> logged in.
    </div>
  );
}
```

- **Preventing Component from Rendering**
  * In a rare situation that you want a component to hide itself even though it was rendered by another component, return `null` instead of its rendered output.
  * *Returning null from a component’s render method does not affect the firing of the component’s lifecycle methods.

### [React - Lists & Keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)

- **Transforming a list in JavaScript**
  * The `map()` function takes an array of numbers and double their values. In the below ex,we assign the new array returned by map() to the variable named `doubled` and log it:
```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);
console.log(doubled);
```
- **Rendering Multiple Components**
  * You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX by simply using curly braces `{}`
  * Belows ex loops through number array(using `map()`) and returns list element for each item (assigning the resulting array to `listItems`):
```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
  <li>{number}</li>
);
```
- **Basic List Component**
  * It typically standard practice to render lists inside of a component
  * To do this, we can refactor the above code into a component that accepts an array of `numbers` and then outputs a list of elements:
```
function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    <li>{number}</li>
  );
  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<NumberList numbers={numbers} />);
```
*Disclaimer*: Running the above code will give you a warning about a key that needs to be provided (Key: a special string attribute that needs to be included when creating a list of elements: `<li key={number.toString()}> {number}</li>`

- **Keys**
  * > Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity
  * Pick a key to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. Best practice is to use IDs from your data as keys:
```const todoItems = todos.map((todo) =>
  <li key={todo.id}>
    {todo.text}
  </li>
);
```
- **Extracting Components with Keys**
  * A good rule of thumb is that elements inside the map() call need keys.
```
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    // Correct! Key should be specified inside the array.
    <ListItem key={number.toString()} value={number} />
  );
```
- **Embedding map() in JSX**
  * > JSX allows embedding any expression in curly braces so we could inline the `map()` result
  * Sometimes this results in clearer code, but this style can also be abused. Like in JavaScript, it is up to you to decide whether it is worth extracting a variable for readability. Keep in mind that if the map() body is too nested, it might be a good time to extract a component.
```
function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  return (
    <ul>
      {numbers.map((number) =>
        <ListItem key={number.toString()}
                  value={number} />
      )}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

### [React - Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)

- > HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state. For example, this form in plain HTML accepts a single name: This form has the default HTML form behavior of browsing to a new page when the user submits the form. If you want this behavior in React, it just works. 
```
<form>
  <label>
    Name:
    <input type="text" name="name" />
  </label>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```
  * it’s convenient to have a JavaScript function that handles the submission of the form (and has access to the data that the user entered into the form). The standard way to achieve this is with a technique called “controlled components”.

- **Controlled Components**
  * Importantant:
    * > In HTML, form elements such as `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState().
- **The textarea Tag**
HTML:
```
<textarea>
  Hello there, this is some text in a text area
</textarea>
```
In React, a `<textarea>` uses a value attribute instead. This way, a form using a `<textarea>` can be written very similarly to a form that uses a single-line input:
```
 this.state = {
      value: 'Please write an essay about your favorite DOM element.'
    };
```
- **Fully-Fledged Solutions**
  * > If you’re looking for a complete solution including validation, keeping track of the visited fields, and handling form submission, [Formik](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik) is one of the popular choices. 
  * Checked it out and this seems like a very useful tool!


### [React - Lifting State](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html)

- Often, several components need to reflect the same changing data. We recommend lifting the shared state up to their closest common ancestor.
- > Usually, the state is first added to the component that needs it for rendering. Then, if other components also need it, you can lift it up to their closest common ancestor. Instead of trying to sync the state between different components, you should rely on the top-down data flow.
- > Lifting state involves writing more “boilerplate” code than two-way binding approaches, but as a benefit, it takes less work to find and isolate bugs. Since any state “lives” in some component and that component alone can change it, the surface area for bugs is greatly reduced. Additionally, you can implement any custom logic to reject or transform user input
### [React - Composition vs Inheritance](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)

- React has a powerful composition model, and we recommend using composition instead of inheritance to reuse code between components.
- **Containment**
  * Some generic “boxes” components like Sidebar or a Dialog box in React are not aware of their children ahead of time. In those cases, React recommends that those components use their special children props to pass the children elements into their output.
```
function QuoteContainer(props) {
  return (
    <div className={'Quote Quote-' + props.color}>
      {props.children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

- **So What About Inheritance?**
  * Facebook has not found any use cases where they would recommend creating component inheritance hierarchies
  * Props and composition provide you all the flexibility you need to customize a component’s look and behavior in efficient way.
  * > If you want to reuse non-UI functionality between components, we suggest extracting it into a separate JavaScript module. The components may import it and use that function, object, or a class, without extending it.

### [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

- > React is, in our opinion, the premier way to build big, fast Web apps with JavaScript. It has scaled very well for us at Facebook and Instagram.
- Steps to thinking in React:
  * Step 1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy
  * Step 2: Build A Static Version in React
  * Step 3: Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State
  * Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live
  * Step 5: Add Inverse Data Flow
