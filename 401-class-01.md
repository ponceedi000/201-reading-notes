### [Pain and Suffering](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-python-guide/curriculum/class-01/notes/pain_suffering)

- An accelerated learning environment can be a great thing, BUT it comes at a price in each of the following categories: physical, mental, and emotional.
- > "All growth comes with some degree of pain, as it pulls you out of your comfort zone."
- It's important not confuse suffering with pain. Suffering is more like pain without purpose, w/o no higher goal, w/o dreams nor ambition/aspiration.
- When things start to get tough, ask yourself these questions:
  * What's your perspective?
  * Why are you doing this?
  * Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?
  * Are you doing this for you?

### [Beginners Guide to Big O](https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/)

- What is Big O notation?
  * > "Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm."
- 0(1)
  * 0(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time regardless of the size of the input data.
  * ` bool IsFirstElementNull(IList<String> elements)
{
    return elements[0] == null;
} `


- O(N)
  * O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
  * > ` bool ContainsValue(IEnumerable<string> elements, string value)
{
    foreach (var element in elements)
    {
        if (element == value) return true; 
    }     
    return false; 
} `

- O(N²)
  * O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.
  * > ` bool ContainsDuplicates(IList<string> elements)
{
    for (var outer = 0; outer < elements.Count; outer++) 
    {
        for (var inner = 0; inner < elements.Count; inner++) 
        { 
            // Don't compare with self 
            if (outer == inner) continue;             
            
            if (elements[outer] == elements[inner]) return true; 
        }
    }    
    return false;
} `

- O(2^N)
  * O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.
  * > ` int Fibonacci(int number)
{
    if (number <= 1) return number;
       
    return Fibonacci(number - 2) + Fibonacci(number - 1); 
} `

### [Names and Values in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AEJHKGk9ns)

- Python
  * Works like other languages (until it doesn't)
  * Mechanisms are simple (but the effects can be surpising)
 - Names are reassigned independently
 - Assignment never copies data
 - immutable values can't alias
 - Function arguments and assignments
 - Names have no type
 - etc.....
