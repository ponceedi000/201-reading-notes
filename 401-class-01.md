### [Pain and Suffering](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-python-guide/curriculum/class-01/notes/pain_suffering)

- An accelerated learning environment can be a great thing, BUT it comes at a price in each of the following categories: physical, mental, and emotional.
- > "All growth comes with some degree of pain, as it pulls you out of your comfort zone."
- It's important not confuse suffering with pain. Suffering is more like pain without purpose, w/o no higher goal, w/o dreams nor ambition/aspiration.
- When things start to get tough, ask yourself these questions:
  * What's your perspective?
  * Why are you doing this?
  * Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?
  * Are you doing this for you?
