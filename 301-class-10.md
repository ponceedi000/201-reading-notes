### [Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4/)
- What is a ‘call’?
  * > At the most basic level, a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).
- How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
  * > 
- What does LIFO mean?
  * > LIFO: When we say that the call stack, operates by the data structure principle of Last In, First Out, it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.
- Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.
  * `function firstFunction(){ console.log("Hello from firstFunction");} function secondFunction(){firstFunction(); console.log("The end from secondFunction");} secondFunction();`

- What causes a Stack Overflow?
  * > A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.


### [JavaScript error messages](https://codeburst.io/javascript-error-messages-debugging-d23f84f0ae7c)



- What is a ‘refrence error’?
  * 
- What is a ‘syntax error’?
  * 
- What is a ‘range error’?
  * 
- What is a ‘tyep error’?

- What is a breakpoint?
- What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?


## Things I want to know more about
- Does NodeJS and ReactJS share any similarities? It seems that they function the same way just w/ slight differnt syntax.
