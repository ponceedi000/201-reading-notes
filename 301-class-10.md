## Readings: FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
***
### [Functional Programming Concepts](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)
- What is functional programming?
  * > Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia
- What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
  * A pure function returns the same result if given the same arguements (also reffered as deterministic)
  * It doesn't cause any observable side effects
- What are the benefits of a pure function?
  * > One of the major benefits of using pure functions is they are immediately testable. They will always produce the same result if you pass in the same arguments. They also makes maintaining and refactoring code much easier. - James Jeffery 
- What is immutability?
  * When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.
- What is Referential transparency?
  * pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency


### [Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHLd36QoS4k)



-What is a module?
  * It's essentially another JavaScript file that is importable or exportable.
- What does the word ‘require’ do?
  * Allows you to use a NodeJS module from another file.
  * EX: `require('./count')`
- How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
  * To access the module functions, we have to export the functions and import them in the file we want to call the functions.
- What do we have to do to make a module available?
  * > The first thing you do to get access to module features is export them. This is done using the export statement. You can export functions, var , let , const , and — as we'll see later — classes. They need to be top-level items; you can't use export inside a function, for example.-MDN Web Docs


## Things I want to know more about
- Does NodeJS and ReactJS share any similarities? It seems that they function the same way just w/ slight differnt syntax.
