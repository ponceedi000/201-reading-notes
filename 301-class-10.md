### [Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4/)
- What is a ‘call’?
  * > At the most basic level, a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).
- How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
  * JavaScript only has one call stack, which is why it can only do one thing at a time.
- What does LIFO mean?
  * > LIFO: When we say that the call stack, operates by the data structure principle of Last In, First Out, it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.
- Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.
  * `function firstFunction(){ console.log("Hello from firstFunction");} function secondFunction(){firstFunction(); console.log("The end from secondFunction");} secondFunction();`
1. When secondFunction() gets executed, an empty stack frame is created. It is the main (anonymous) entry point of the program.
2. secondFunction() then calls firstFunction()which is pushed into the stack.
3. firstFunction() returns and prints “Hello from firstFunction” to the console.
4. firstFunction() is pop off the stack.
5. The execution order then move to secondFunction().
6. secondFunction() returns and print “The end from secondFunction” to the console.
7. secondFunction() is pop off the stack, clearing the memory.

- What causes a Stack Overflow?
  * > A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.


### [JavaScript error messages](https://codeburst.io/javascript-error-messages-debugging-d23f84f0ae7c)



- What is a ‘refrence error’?
  * In JavaScript, a reference error is thrown when a code attempts to reference a non-existing variable.
- What is a ‘syntax error’?
  * An exception caused by the incorrect use of a pre-defined syntax. For example, if you leave off a closing brace ( } ) when defining a JavaScript function, you trigger a syntax error.
- What is a ‘range error’?
  * A RangeError is thrown when trying to pass a value as an argument to a function that does not allow a range that includes the value. This can be encountered when: passing a value that is not one of the allowed string values to String.
- What is a ‘tyep error’?
  * The TypeError object represents an error when an operation could not be performed, typically (but not exclusively) when a value is not of the expected type. A TypeError may be thrown when: an operand or argument passed to a function is incompatible with the type expected by that operator or function;
- What is a breakpoint?
  * In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code. At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values. After examining values, you can resume the execution of code (typically with a play button).
- What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?
  * The debugger statement invokes any available debugging functionality, such as setting a breakpoint. If no debugging functionality is available, this statement has no effect.
  * EX:
` function potentiallyBuggyCode() {
    debugger;
    // do potentially buggy stuff to examine, step through, etc.
} `


## Things I want to know more about
- Does NodeJS and ReactJS share any similarities? It seems that they function the same way just w/ slight differnt syntax.
