### [Next.js - Dynamic Routes](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/dynamic-routes)

- Page Path Depends on External Data
  * Next.js allows you to statically generate pages with paths that depend on external data. This enables dynamic URLs in Next.js.

- Implement getStaticProps
  * It's important to fetch necessary data to render the post with the given `id`.
  * Add the following`getPostData` function at the bottom. It will return the post data based on id:

```
//FILE PATH: lib/posts.js

export function getPostData(id) {
  const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, `${id}.md`)
  const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8')

  // Use gray-matter to parse the post metadata section
  const matterResult = matter(fileContents)

  // Combine the data with the id
  return {
    id,
    ...matterResult.data
  }
}
```
-  In `pagess/posts/[id].js`, use the following code:
  * The post page is now using the getPostData function in getStaticProps to get the post data and return it as props.
```
import { getAllPostIds, getPostData } from '../../lib/posts'

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const postData = getPostData(params.id)
  return {
    props: {
      postData
    }
  }
}
```
- update the Post component to use postData. In pages/posts/[id].js replace the exported Post component with the following code:
```
export default function Post({ postData }) {
  return (
    <Layout>
      {postData.title}
      <br />
      {postData.id}
      <br />
      {postData.date}
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

- To render markdown content, we’ll use the remark library
  * `npm install remark remark-html`
- Then, open lib/posts.js and add the following imports to the top of the file:
```
import { remark } from 'remark'
import html from 'remark-html'
```
- Update the `getPostData()` function and use `remark`
```
export async function getPostData(id) {
  const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, `${id}.md`)
  const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8')

  // Use gray-matter to parse the post metadata section
  const matterResult = matter(fileContents)

  // Use remark to convert markdown into HTML string
  const processedContent = await remark()
    .use(html)
    .process(matterResult.content)
  const contentHtml = processedContent.toString()

  // Combine the data with the id and contentHtml
  return {
    id,
    contentHtml,
    ...matterResult.data
  }
}
```
- Important: We added the async keyword to getPostData because we need to use await for remark. async/await allow you to fetch data asynchronously.
```
export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  // Add the "await" keyword like this:
  const postData = await getPostData(params.id)
  // ...
}
```
- Lastly, update the `post` component in `pages/posts/[id].js` to render `contentHtml` by using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`:
```
export default function Post({ postData }) {
  return (
    <Layout>
      {postData.title}
      <br />
      {postData.id}
      <br />
      {postData.date}
      <br />
      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: postData.contentHtml }} />
    </Layout>
  )
}
```
### [Next.js - Deployment](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/deploying-nextjs-app)

- Deploy to Vercel
  * > The easiest way to deploy Next.js to production is to use the Vercel platform developed by the creators of Next.js. Vercel is a serverless platform for static and hybrid applications built to integrate with your headless content, commerce, or database. We make it easy for frontend teams to develop, preview, and ship delightful user experiences, where performance is the default.
  * Give Vercel access to GitHub repositories
  * Import your project to Vercel
  * *When you deploy, your Next.js app will start building. It should finish in under a minute
  * When it’s done, you’ll get deployment URLs. Click on one of the URLs and you should see the Next.js starter page live.

- What is Vercel?
  * Vercel is made by the same creators of Next.js and has very good support for Next.Js.
  * Some things are done automatically handled after deploying your app to Vercel:
    * Pages that use Static Generation and assets (JS, CSS, images, fonts, etc) will automatically be served from the Vercel Edge Network, which is blazingly fast.
    * Pages that use Server-Side Rendering and API routes will automatically become isolated Serverless Functions. This allows page rendering and API requests to scale infinitely.

- Vercel's extra features:
  * **Custom Domains:** Once deployed on Vercel, you can assign a custom domain to your Next.js app. Take a look at our documentation here.
  * **Environment Variables:** You can also set environment variables on Vercel. Take a look at our documentation here. You can then use those environment variables in your Next.js app.
  * **Automatic HTTPS:** HTTPS is enabled by default (including custom domains) and doesn't require extra configuration. We auto-renew SSL certificates.

- DPS: Deploy, Preview, and Ship
  * **Develop:** We’ve written code in Next.js and used the Next.js development server running to take advantage of its hot reloading feature.
  * ** Preview:** We’ve pushed changes to a branch on GitHub, and Vercel created a preview deployment that’s available via a URL. We can share this preview URL with others for feedback. In addition to doing code reviews, you can do deployment previews.
  * **Ship:** We’ve merged the pull request to main to ship to production.
