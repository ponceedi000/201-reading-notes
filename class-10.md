## Readings: Debugging
***
### Chapter 10: “Error Handling & Debugging” - From the Duckett JS book
- > "JavaSCript can be hard to learn and everyone makes mistakes when writiing it."
  * I really liked the way this chapter opens. When coding JavaScript, you're likely to make a mistake at some point and I'm excited to learn how to properly debug code efficiently!
-Finding the source of an error is easier to find if you how the scripts are processed. "The order in which statements are executed can be complex; some tasks cannot complete until another statement or function has been run." - Duckett
