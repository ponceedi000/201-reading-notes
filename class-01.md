## Check out my notes in outline form!
(These is notes are thoughts written from the books, "HTML&CSS" by John Duckett and "JavaSCript&JQuery" by John Duckett.)
### Introduction (pp.2-11)
I've come to the conclusion that HTML is essentially like the bones of a a human body. HTML is in a nut-shell, the structure of content on a web page that users can visibily see. CSS is simlar to the organs of the body; what creates 'boring' HTML into something easy to read i.e organized, colorful, and stylistic. Again, these languages are most commonly used for websites and web applications. People access the web in very similar ways such as utilizing web browsers, web servers, devices, and screen readers.

### HTML Chapter 1: “Structure” (pp.12-39)
Simliar to how a newspaper presents it's information or how a writer structures their books, HTML serves the same purpose but on a website. HTML describes the structure of your web pages with elements often used with open/closed tags. Some of the key elements include the following: body, heading, paragraph, ordered/unordered lists, div, etc. These are written with letters and sybmols for example `<h1>` (opening tag) and `</h1>` (closing tag).

### HTML Chapter 8: “Extra Markup” (p.176-199)
A lot has changed the beginning of the world wide web. There have been multiple different versions of HTML in the last 20+ years. HTML 4 was was released in 1997, XHTML was released in 2000 which was created to mimic XML. Over the years, developers disputed which Markup language was the best/worst. HTML5 to this day is the most up-to-date Markup language used today. In fact, it's still being improved to this day. After reading this chapter I learned there is even more you can do with HTML5. You can add comments to your code, use id and class attributes to select paticular elements, use <meta> tags for information, and how to create special characters in your markup.

### HTML Chapter 17: “HTML5 Layout” (pp.428-451)
After reading this chapter, I came to the conclusion that HTML5 is evolving fast and becoming more powerful each day. There are now some browsers such as Internet Explorer that can't support or understand HTML5 elements. To attempt making HTML5 work on older browsers now needs someone help of extra JavaScript.
