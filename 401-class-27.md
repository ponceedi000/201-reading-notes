### [Using Models](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Models)
- What are models?
  * Django web apps access & manage data through Python objects but Django refers to Python objects as models
- What do models do?
  * They define the structure of data to be stored. This includes field types, their max size. default values, selection list options, help text, label texts, etc.
- Models definition:
  * > "The definition of the model is independent of the underlying database — you can choose one of several as part of your project settings. Once you've chosen what database you want to use, you don't need to talk to it directly at all — you just write your model structure and other code, and Django handles all the dirty work of communicating with the database for you."
- Using models:
  * When designing models, it makes most sense to have seperate models per object ) a group of related information)
  * Django allows you to define relationships that are:
    * one to one: `OneToOneField`
    * one to many: `ForeignKey`
    * many to many: `ManyToManyField`
- Where are models defined?
  * MOdels are usually defined in an application's `models.py` file. They are implemented as subclassess of `django.db.models.Model`, and can included fields, methods and metadata. The code fragment below show a "typical" model, named `MyModelName`:
```
from django.db import models

class MyModelName(models.Model):
    """A typical class defining a model, derived from the Model class."""

    # Fields
    my_field_name = models.CharField(max_length=20, help_text='Enter field documentation')
    ...

    # Metadata
    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-my_field_name']

    # Methods
    def get_absolute_url(self):
        """Returns the url to access a particular instance of MyModelName."""
        return reverse('model-detail-view', args=[str(self.id)])

    def __str__(self):
        """String for representing the MyModelName object (in Admin site etc.)."""
        return self.my_field_name
```

- Once you've defined your model classses you can use them to perform any CRUD method along with running queiries to get all records or particular subsets of records
  * Creating and modifying records: You can access the fields in this new record using the dot syntax, and change the values. You have to call `save()` to store modeified values to the database.
  * Searching for records: You can search for records that match certain criteria using the model's objects attribute (provided by the base class). We can get all records for a model as a `QuerySet`, using `objects.all()`. The QuerySet is an iterable object, meaning that it contains a number of objects that we can iterate/loop through.

- Once all of your models have been created, re-run your database migrations to add them to your database.
```
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```
