## Readings : Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

### [Understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming](https://simpleprogrammer.com/understanding-the-problem-domain-is-the-hardest-part-of-programming)
- Unfortunetly I had to start this reading by looking up the definition of 'problem domain' before further reading into this blog. See below the definition:
- > A problem domain is the area of expertise or application that needs to be examined to solve a problem. A problem domain is simply looking at only the topics of an individual's interest, and excluding everything else. - John Sonmez
- The author explains that putting together a jigsaw puzzle is similar to coding. Sometimes you get a tough puzzle that can take hours if not days to piece to fully piece together and when you're stuck, you have to figure out where the problem is originating from in order to move foward or complete your project! Sounds like coding in a nutshell to me...
- > We put together code with the purpose of building components that we have taken out of the “bigger picture” of the problem domain. - John Sonmez
- The author states that as programmers, we're often not given complete information about the problem domain.. so from the start, we're already don't have the information we need to understand it. In an opposite scenario, programming becomes **much** easier!
- He says that it is often beneficial to take a part of the problem and fully understand that part before expanding the problem domain. I found 
The big issue is that many problem domains are like a puzzle with a blurry picture or no picture at all.
