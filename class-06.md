## Readings : Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

### [Understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming](https://simpleprogrammer.com/understanding-the-problem-domain-is-the-hardest-part-of-programming)
- Unfortunetly I had to start this reading by looking up the definition of 'problem domain' before further reading into this blog. See below the definition:
- > A problem domain is the area of expertise or application that needs to be examined to solve a problem. A problem domain is simply looking at only the topics of an individual's interest, and excluding everything else.
- The author explains that putting together a jigsaw puzzle is similar to coding. Sometimes you get a tough puzzle that can take hours if not days to piece to fully piece together and when you're stuck, you have to figure out where the problem is originating from in order to move foward or complete your project! Sounds like coding in a nutshell to me...
