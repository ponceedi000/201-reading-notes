### [Django Settings Best Practices](https://djangostars.com/blog/configuring-django-settings-best-practices/)

- Managing Django Settings: Issues
  * **Different environments**. Usually, you have several environments to include: local, dev, ci, qa, staging, production, etc. Each environment can have its own specific settings (for example: DEBUG = True, more verbose logging, additional apps, some mocked data, etc).
  * **Sensitive data**. You have SECRET_KEY in each Django project. On top of this there can be DB passwords and tokens for third-party APIs like Amazon or Twitter. *THIS CANNOT BE STORED IN VCS*
  * **Sharing settings between team members.**: You need a general approach to eliminate human error when working with the settings.
  * **Django settings are a Python code.** This is a curse and a blessing at the same time. It gives you a lot of flexibility, but can also be a problem – instead of key-value pairs, settings.py can have a very tricky logic.
- Setting Configuration: Different Approaches
  * > There is no built-in universal way to configure Django settings without hardcoding them. But books, open-source and work projects provide a lot of recommendations and approaches on how to do it best.

  * Codebase
  * Dependencies
  * Config
  * Backing services
  * Build, release, run
  * Processes
  * Port binding
  * Concurrency
  * Disposability
  * Dev/prod parity
  * Logs
  * Admin processes

- Best practices for Django settings
  * Keep settings in environment variables.
  * Write default values for production configuration (excluding secret keys and tokens).
  * Don’t hardcode sensitive settings, and don’t put them in VCS.
  * Split settings into groups: Django, third-party, project.
  * Follow naming conventions for custom (project) settings.
