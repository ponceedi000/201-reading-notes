### [Dunder Methods](https://dbader.org/blog/python-dunder-methods)
- What Are Dunder Methods?
  * In Python, special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes.
  * They are easy to recognize b/c they start and end with double underscores
  * "Dunder Methods": a short form of "double under"
  * Also refered to as "magic methods"

- Special Methods and the Python Data Model
  * The Python data model and lets developers tap into rich language features like sequences, iteration, operator overloading, attribute access, etc.

- **Enriching a Class: common dunder methods:**
  * Initialization of new objects
  * Object representation
  * Enable iteration
  * Operator overloading (comparison)
  * Operator overloading (addition)
  * Method invocation
  * Context manager support (with statement)

- **Object Initialization: __init__**
  * Right upon starting a class, we need a special method to construct objects from our class (e.g. constructor)
  * The constructor takes care of setting up the object.
EX: In this cases it recieves the owner name, an optional start amount and defines an internal transactions list to keep track of deposits and withdrawls.
```
class Account:
    """A simple account class"""

    def __init__(self, owner, amount=0):
        """
        This is the constructor that lets us create
        objects from this class
        """
        self.owner = owner
        self.amount = amount
        self._transactions = []
        
// This allows us to create new accounts like this:
>>> acc = Account('bob')  # default amount = 0
>>> acc = Account('bob', 10)
```

-** Object Representation: __str__, __repr__:** It is common practice to provide a string representation of your object for the consumer of your class. Here are two differnt ways to do this using dunder methods:
  * **__repr__:** The “official” string representation of an object. This is how you would make an object of the class. The goal of __repr__ is to be unambiguous.
  * **__str__:** The “informal” or nicely printable string representation of an object. This is for the enduser.
```
class Account:
    # ... (see above)

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Account({!r}, {!r})'.format(self.owner, self.amount)

    def __str__(self):
        return 'Account of {} with starting amount: {}'.format(
            self.owner, self.amount)
            
>>> str(acc)
'Account of bob with starting amount: 10'

>>> print(acc)
"Account of bob with starting amount: 10"

>>> repr(acc)
"Account('bob', 10)"
```

- **Iteration: __len__, __getitem__, __reversed__**
  * `__len__`: The Python __len__ method returns a positive integer that represents the length of the object on which it is called. It implements the built-in len() function. For example, if you call len(x) an object x, Python internally calls x.__len__() to determine the length of object x.
  * `__getitem__`: The use of __getitem__() in a class allows the instances of a class to use the indexer operator [ ] with the reference variables of a class for accessing the value of a list, dictionary, or tuple from a specific index.
  * `__reversed__`: The __reversed__ dunder method uses slicing with negative step size to return the reversed string object when calling reversed() on a object

- **Operator Overloading for Comparing Accounts: __eq__, __lt__**
  * IF you tried comparing two objects to one another without the above dunder methods, then you'll likely encounter a type error b/c we have not implemented any comparison dunders nor inherited them from a parent class.
  * > To not have to implement all of the comparison dunder methods, I use the functools.total_ordering decorator which allows me to take a shortcut, only implementing __eq__ and __lt__:
```
from functools import total_ordering

@total_ordering
class Account:
    # ... (see above)

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.balance == other.balance

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.balance < other.balance
        
// And now I can compare Account instances no problem:
>>> acc2 > acc
True
>>> acc2 < acc
False
>>> acc == acc2
False
```
- **Operator Overloading for Merging Accounts: __add__**
  * Our Account object does not support addition yet, so when you try to add two instances of it there’s a TypeError:
```
>>> acc + acc2
TypeError: "unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'Account' and 'Account'"
```
So next, lets implement the add dunder method
```
def __add__(self, other):
    owner = self.owner + other.owner
    start_amount = self.balance + other.balance
    return Account(owner, start_amount)
```
- **Callable Python Objects: __call__**
  * You can make an object callable like a regular function by adding the `__call__` dunder method.

### [Iterators](https://dbader.org/blog/python-iterators)
- How do for-in loops work in Python?
  * It first prepared the repeater object for iteration by calling its __iter__ method. This returned the actual iterator object.
After that, the loop repeatedly calls the iterator object’s __next__ method to retrieve values from it.
```
repeater = Repeater('Hello')
iterator = repeater.__iter__()
while True:
    item = iterator.__next__()
    print(item)
```
- Snapshot:
  * Iterators provide a sequence interface to Python objects that’s memory efficient and considered Pythonic. Behold the beauty of the for-in loop!
  * To support iteration an object needs to implement the iterator protocol by providing the __iter__ and __next__ dunder methods.
  * Class-based iterators are only one way to write iterable objects in Python. Also consider generators and generator expressions.
