### [Beginner’s Guide to Docker](https://wsvincent.com/beginners-guide-to-docker/)

- Linux Containers
  * Docker (which I assume will be covered next) os really just like Linux containers which are a type of virtualization
- What is virtualization?
  * Originates from the beginning of computer science when large expensive mainframe computers were the "normal". To allow multiple programmers to use the same single machine, they used virtual machines which are complete copies of a computer system for the operating system on up.
  * Downside of virtual machines: Size and Speed.
    * > A typical guest operating system can easily take up 700MB of size. So if one physical server supports three virtual machines, that’s at least 2.1GB of disk space taken up along with separate needs for CPU and memory resources.
  * > Most computers rely on the same Linux operating system, so what if we virtualized from that level up instead? Wouldn’t that provide a lightweight, faster way to duplicate much of the same functionality?
    * > The answer is yes. And in recent years Linux containers, also known as “containerization,” has become increasingly popular. For most applications, a virtual machine provides far more resources than are needed and a container is more than sufficient.
  * Above is fundamentally what Docker is. An efficient way to implement Linux containers.
- Containers vs Virtual Environments
  * Virtual Environments: They are used to isolate Python software packages locally. We can create an isolated box for individual projects so one can use Python 2.7 and Django 1.5 while another can use Python 3.5 and Django 2.1 on the same computer.
  * Containers: "A Docker container encapsulates an entire OS. With a Python virtualenv, you can easily switch between Python versions and dependencies, but you're stuck with your host OS. With a Docker image, you can swap out the entire OS - install and run Python on Ubuntu, Debian, Alpine, even Windows Server Core. There are Docker images out there with every combination of OS and Python versions you can think of, ready to pull down and use on any system with Docker installed." - [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50974960/whats-the-difference-between-docker-and-python-virtualenv)


- Images and Containers - "Images and containers are the two fundamental concepts to grasp when you start with Docker."
  * Images: An image is a snapshot in time of what a project contains.
  * Containers: A container is a running instance of the image.

- Takeaways:
  * Docker is a way to run Linux containers
  * Containers are a lightweight alternative to Virtual Machines
  * `Dockerfil`e is a list of instructions for creating an image
  * Images are made up one or more layers
  * Containers are a running instance of an image
  * `docker-compose.yml` controls how to run the container
  * Containers are a stateless and ephemeral in nature. We can link the local filesystem via `volumes` but things become more complex with databases




### [Django for APIs - Library Website](https://djangoforapis.com/library-website-and-api/)

- > Django REST Framework works alongside the Django web framework to create web APIs. We cannot build a web API with only Django Rest Framework. It always must be added to a project after Django itself has been installed and configured.
