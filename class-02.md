## Readings : Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

### Chapter 2: “Text” (pp.40-61) -From the Duckett HTML book
-With HTML, you have the ability to modify text without having to use CSS; This is called Structural Markup. Examples of this look like adding headings, subheadings, paragraphs, boldness, italics, superscripts,subscripts, lines breaks and horizontal breaks utilizing simple tags. Semantic Markup however is differen't in a sense that it does not affect the structure of your webpage.
- Semantic Markup adds extra information to the webpage. Examples of this would be abbreviations used in your HTML. If i were to abbreviate "United States of America" , I could use `<abbr title="United States of America>USA</abbr>` and if I were to hover over "USA", the user could see what the abbreviation stood for. The same idea is applied to the rest of the Semantic Markup.

### Chapter 10: Ch.10 “Introducing CSS” (pp.226-245) -From the Duckett HTML book
My favorite quote from this chapter was > "the key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element."
