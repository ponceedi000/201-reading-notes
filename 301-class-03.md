## Readings: State and Props
***
### [React: Component Lifecycle Events](https://medium.com/@joshuablankenshipnola/react-component-lifecycle-events-cb77e670a093) - Joshua Blakenship
- Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?
  * render
- What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
  * > Mounting: " When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM it occurs during the mounting phase. Constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount, and UNSAFE_componentWillMount all occur in this order during mounting. "  - Joshua Blakenship
- Put the following things in the order that they happen:
  * constructor
  * render
  * componentDidMount
  * React Updates
  * componentWillUnmount
  
- What does componentDidMount do?
  * > This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, don’t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().
setState() can be called here, but it should be used sparingly, because it will cause a rerender, which can lead to perfomance issues.

- What types of things can you pass in the props?
  * you to pass variables from one to another component down the component tree
  * props can be anything from integers over objects to arrays
- What is the big difference between props and state?
  * state is internal and controlled by the component itself while props are external and controlled by whatever renders the component.
- When do we re-render our application?
  * React components automatically re-render whenever there is a change in their state or props
- What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
  * Well a component state is an object so it should be able to store any sort of data type, right?
