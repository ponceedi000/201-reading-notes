### [Read & Write Files in Python](https://realpython.com/read-write-files-python/)

- What Is a File?
  * > "... a file is a contigous set of bytes used to store data. This data is organized in a specific format and can be anything as simple as a text file or as complicated as a program executable. In the end, these byte files are then translated into binary 1 and 0 for easier processing by the computer."
- Most modern files systems include three main parts:
  * Header: metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)
  * Data: contents of the file as written by the creator or editor
  * End of file (EOF): special character that indicates the end of the file.
- What is a file path?
  * A file path is a string that represents the location of a file
  * Thre major parts include:
    * Folder Path: the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are seperated by a foward slash / (Unix) or backslash \ (windows)
    * File Name: the actual name of the file
    * Extension: the end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) used to indicate the file type
- Character Encodings:
  * > "Another common problem that you may face is the encoding of the byte data. An encoding is a translation from byte data to human readable characters. This is typically done by assigning a numerical value to represent a character. The two most common encodings are the ASCII and UNICODE Formats."
- Opening and Closing a File in Python
  * Working with Python, at some point you will want to work with files inside you code. The first thing you'll want to do is figure out how to open it... THis is done with `open()` built-in-function. 
  * > "... has a single required argument that is the path to the file. open() has a single return, the file object:"
  * EX:
```
file = open('dog_breeds.txt')
```
- The with statement automatically takes care of closing the file once it leaves the with block, even in cases of error. EX:
```
with open('dog_breeds.txt') as reader:
    # Further file processing goes here
```
- Common Modes for files:
  * `'r'` = Open for reading (default)
  * `'w'` = Open for writing, truncating (overwriting) the file first
  * `'rb'` or `'wb'`  = Open in binary mode (read/write using byte data)
- Reading and Writing Opened Files
  * > "Once you've opened up a file, you'll want to read or write to the file". We can use multiple methods that can be called on a file object:
  * `.read(size=-1)`  = This reads from the file based on the number of size bytes. If no argument is passed or None or -1 is passed, then the entire file is read.
  * `.readline(size=-1)` = This reads at most size number of characters from the line. This continues to the end of the line and then wraps back around. If no argument is passed or None or -1 is passed, then the entire line (or rest of the line) is read.
  * `.readlines()`  = This reads the remaining lines from the file object and returns them as a list.
- __file__
  * The __file__ attribute is a special attribute of modules, similar to __name__.
  * > “the pathname of the file from which the module was loaded, if it was loaded from a file.” - [Python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html)
- Working With Two Files at the Same Time:
  * EX:
```
d_path = 'dog_breeds.txt'
d_r_path = 'dog_breeds_reversed.txt'
with open(d_path, 'r') as reader, open(d_r_path, 'w') as writer:
    dog_breeds = reader.readlines()
    writer.writelines(reversed(dog_breeds))
```
