### [Django Forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Models)
- HTML Form
  * > This is a group of one or more fields/widgets on a web page, which can be used to collect information from users submission to a server.
  * Forms are meant for collecting user input because there are so many suitable widgets out there for entering all types of data to include:
    * text boxes
    * checkboxes
    * radio buttons
    * date pickers
    * etc.
 * Forms are a secure way to share data with a server: They allow us to send data via POST requests with cross-site request forgery protection
Example:
  ```
  <form action="/team_name_url/" method="post">
    <label for="team_name">Enter name: </label>
    <input id="team_name" type="text" name="name_field" value="Default name for team.">
    <input type="submit" value="OK">
  </form>
  ```
- `action`: The resource/URL where data is to be sent for processing when the form is sunmitted.
- `method`: The HTTP method used to data somewhere: `POST` OR `GET`
  * `POST`: This method should always be useed if the data is going to result in a change to the server's database b/c this can be made more resistant to **cross-site** forgery request attacks
  * `GET`: This method should only be used for forms that don't chamge user data such as a search form. It is recommended for when you want to be able to bookmark or share the URL

#### Django form handling process
- Django's form handling techniques are very similar to when we display information from a model
  * The view gets a request, performs any actions required including reading data from the models, then generates and returns as an HTML page from a template, into which we pass a context containing the data to be displayed
- Where it gets complicated:
  * The server also needs to be able to process data provided by the user, and then redisplay the page if there are any errors

- The image above demonstrates Django's handling process for forms:
  1. Display the default form the first time it is requested by the user
  2. Recieve data from a submit request and bind it to the form
  3. Clean and validate the data
  4. If any data is invalid, re-display the form, this time with any user populated values and error messages for the problem fields
  5. If all data is valid, perform required actions:
    * save data
    * send an email
    * return the result of a search
    * upload a file
    * etc.
  6. Once all actions are complete, redirect the user to another page
