### [Django Forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Models)
- HTML Form
  * > This is a group of one or more fields/widgets on a web page, which can be used to collect information from users submission to a server.
  * Forms are meant for collecting user input because there are so many suitable widgets out there for entering all types of data to include:
    * text boxes
    * checkboxes
    * radio buttons
    * date pickers
    * etc.
 * Forms are a secure way to share data with a server: They allow us to send data via POST requests with cross-site request forgery protection
Example:
  ```
  <form action="/team_name_url/" method="post">
    <label for="team_name">Enter name: </label>
    <input id="team_name" type="text" name="name_field" value="Default name for team.">
    <input type="submit" value="OK">
  </form>
  ```
- `action`: The resource/URL where data is to be sent for processing when the form is sunmitted.
- `method`: The HTTP method used to data somewhere: `POST` OR `GET`
  * `POST`: This method should always be useed if the data is going to result in a change to the server's database b/c this can be made more resistant to **cross-site** forgery request attacks
  * `GET`: This method should only be used for forms that don't chamge user data such as a search form. It is recommended for when you want to be able to bookmark or share the URL
  *
