## Readings: CSS Tips and Tricks
***
### [CSS Transforms](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/)
- > With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.
- The `transform` property come ins two differnt settings:
  * two-dimensional
    * > Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes.
  * three-dimensional
    * > Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis.
- 2D Rotate: The `transform` property can handle multiple types of values.
  * The `rotate` value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees; positive values with rotate clockwise and negative values will rotate counterclockwise.
- 2D Scale: The `scale` value within the `transform` property allows you to change the appeared size of an element.
  * The scaleX value will scale the width of an element while the scaleY value will scale the height of an element.
- 2D Translate: The `translate` value works a bit like that of relative positioning by utilizing `translateX` and `translateY`
- There are many more values that are used with 2D & 3D Transformations such as:
  * `Skew`, `Cube`. `transform-origin`, `perspective`

### [Transitions & Animations](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)
- > Transitions: for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`, and `:target pseudo-classes`.
- Four transitions related properties: (The first three are the most popular)
  * `transition-property`, `transition-duration`, `transition-timing-function`, `transition-delay`
