## Readings: Intro to Django
***

### [Getting started with Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/)
- Object-relational mapper
  * You should define your data models entirely in Python and to get a rich, dynamic database-access API... however you can use SQL if needed.
- URLs and Views
  * A clean and elegant URL scheme is important for a high quality web application
  * Django encourages beautiful URL design
  * To design URLs for an application, you create a Python module called a `URLconf`
- Templates
  * Django's template language is design bring power and ease to your coding experience
  * It is designed to feel comftorable and eas to learn for those that are used to working with HTML
- Forms
  * Django provides a powerful form library that handles forms as HTML, validates user input, and converts data to naitive Python types
Form EX: 
```
from django import forms

class BandContactForm(forms.Form):
    subject = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
    message = forms.CharField()
    sender = forms.EmailField()
    cc_myself = forms.BooleanField(required=False)
```
- Authentication
  * > Django comes with a full-featured and secure authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions. This lets you easily build sites that allow users to create accounts and safely log in/out.
- Admin
  * Django provides a powerful automatic admin interface.
  *  > It reads metadata in your models to provide a powerful and production-ready interface that content producers can immediately use to start managing content on your site.
- Internationalization
  * Django supports translating text into differnt languages, plus locale-specific formatting of dates, times, numbers, and time zones.
  * > It lets developers and template authors specify which parts of their apps should be translated or formatted for local languages and cultures, and it uses these hooks to localize web applications for particular users according to their preferences.
- Security - Django provides multiple protections against:
  * Clickjacking
  * Cross-site scripting
  * Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  * SQL injection
  * Remote code execution

### [How Django Works Behind the Scenes](https://wsvincent.com/how-django-works-behind-the-scenes/)

- What is Django?
  * > Django is a Python-based web framework used by millions of developers and billions of consumers through popular apps like Instagram. It is open source, meaning the code is available for free on Github and can be downloaded onto any developer’s computer and used alongside the official documentation.
- History
  * > Django was originally developed at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper by Adrian Holovaty, Simon Willison, and Jacob Kaplan-Moss. The code was open-sourced in 2005 and developers immediately started making contributions to the codebase. Fourteen years later, Django remains under active development, with new major releases every nine months, minor security releases almost monthly, an official issue tracker, and robust discussion on the django-developers Google group.
- Open Source Pros and Cons:
  * Pros: Writing is code if fun for many developers and they're generally willing to contribute their time for free
  * Cons: There are many not-so-fun tasks involved such as handling legal/trademark issues, traiging tickets, guiding community discussions, organizing conferences, managing releases, etc.
- Django Software Foundation (DSF)
  * > The DSF supports and maintains Django in a number of capacities. The largest expense, by far, is the Fellows Program, paid contractors who triage tickets, manage releases, and generally perform the unsexy but necessary work needed to keep Django on track.
- Technical Organization
  * > Historically, Django followed Python’s model of having a Benevolent Dictator for Life, that is, a project founder who retained final say for disputes/arguments within the community. Adrian Holovaty and Jacob Kaplan-Moss functioned as Django’s dual-BDFLs from 2005 until their retirement in 2014. Django has a small, core team of trusted volunteers who work alongside the Django Fellows to manage technical side of the Django Project. Django Core members are divided into teams that have authority over the Django Project infrastructure, including the Django Project website itself, the official issue tracker, official mailing lists, IRC channels, and more.

- Conclusion:
  * Django's foundational code is open source and open to all
  * Django's organization is managed by a non-profit
  * Django's code is lead by a team of volunteers, Django Fellows, and a larger group of contributors
