***

### [Getting started with Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/)
- Object-relational mapper
  * You should define your data models entirely in Python and to get a rich, dynamic database-access API... however you can use SQL if needed.
- URLs and Views
  * A clean and elegant URL scheme is important for a high quality web application
  * Django encourages beautiful URL design
  * To design URLs for an application, you create a Python module called a `URLconf`
- Templates
  * Django's template language is design bring power and ease to your coding experience
  * It is designed to feel comftorable and eas to learn for those that are used to working with HTML
- Forms
  * Django provides a powerful form library that handles forms as HTML, validates user input, and converts data to naitive Python types
Form EX: 
```
from django import forms

class BandContactForm(forms.Form):
    subject = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
    message = forms.CharField()
    sender = forms.EmailField()
    cc_myself = forms.BooleanField(required=False)
```
- Authentication
  * > Django comes with a full-featured and secure authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions. This lets you easily build sites that allow users to create accounts and safely log in/out.
- Admin
  * Django provides a powerful automatic admin interface.
  *  > It reads metadata in your models to provide a powerful and production-ready interface that content producers can immediately use to start managing content on your site.
- Internationalization
  * Django supports translating text into differnt languages, plus locale-specific formatting of dates, times, numbers, and time zones.
  * > It lets developers and template authors specify which parts of their apps should be translated or formatted for local languages and cultures, and it uses these hooks to localize web applications for particular users according to their preferences.
- Security - Django provides multiple protections against:
  * Clickjacking
  * Cross-site scripting
  * Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  * SQL injection
  * Remote code execution
