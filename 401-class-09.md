### [Dunder Methods](https://dbader.org/blog/python-dunder-methods)

- What Are Dunder Methods?
  * > "In Python, special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores, for example __init__ or __str__. As it quickly became tiresome to say under-under-method-under-under Pythonistas adopted the term “dunder methods”, a short form of “double under.”"
  * The dunder methods are also sometimes called "magic methods".
  * Dunder methods let you emulate the behavior of built-in types.
- Object Initialization: __init__
  * Dunder init is needed for constructors in Python. This helps take care of setting up the object
- Object Representation: __str__, __repr__
  * __repr__: "The “official” string representation of an object. This is how you would make an object of the class. The goal of __repr__ is to be unambiguous."
  * __str__: "The “informal” or nicely printable string representation of an object. This is for the enduser."


### [Statistics - Probability](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/basic-statistics-in-python-probability/)

- What is probability?
  * > At the most basic level, probability seeks to answer the question, “What is the chance of an event happening?” An event is some outcome of interest. To calculate the chance of an event happening, we also need to consider all the other events that can occur. The quintessential representation of probability is the humble coin toss.
- The data and the distribution:
  * The most important qualities to notice about the normal distribution is its symmetry and its shape. 
  * In probability, the normal distribution is a particular distribution of the probability across all of the events.
