## Readings: Stacks and Queues
***

### [Stacks and Queues](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/stacks_and_queues.html)

- Common Terminology for a stack:
  * *push* - Nodes or items that are put into the stack pushed
  * *pop* - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to `pop` an empty stack, an exception will be raised.
  * *Top* - This is the top of the stack
  * *Peek* - When you peek you will view the value of the `top` Node in the stack. When you attemp to peek an empty stack, an exception will be raised.
  * *isEmpty* - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

- FILO - First In Last Out
  * Meaning, the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.
- LIFO - Last In First Out
  * Meaning, the last item added to the stack will ne the first item popped out of the stack.

- Stack Visualization: What does a stack look like?

  * This visualization was super helpful for me!

- What is a queue?
  * *Enqueue* - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
  * *Dequeue* - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
  * *Front* - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
  * *Rear* - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
  * *Peek* - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
  * *IsEmpty* - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

- FIFO - First In First Out
  * This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

- LILO - Last In Last Out
  * This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.
