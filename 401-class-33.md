### [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction/)

- What is a JSON Web Token?
  * > JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret or a publblic/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
  * JWTs can be encrypted to also provide secrecy between parties
  * Signed tokens can verify the integrity of the claims contained within it, while encrypted tokens hide those claims from other parties.
  * When tokens are signed using a public or private key pair, the signature also certifies that only the pary holding the private key is the one that signed it.
- When should you use a JWT?
  * **Authorization**: "This is the most common scenario for using JWT. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used across different domains."
  * **Information Exchange:**  JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. Because JWTs can be signed—for example, using public/private key pairs—you can be sure the senders are who they say they are. Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload, you can also verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.

- What does a JSON Web Token structure look like?
  * JWT's consist of three parts:
    * Header
    * Payload
    * Signature
  * JWT's typlically look like : `xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz`
- Header: The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.
- Payload: The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims.
- Signature: To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.

### [DRF JWT Authentication](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2018/12/19/how-to-use-jwt-authentication-with-django-rest-framework.html)

- Installation
  * `pip install djangorestframework_simplejwt`

- Settings.py:

```REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication.JWTAuthentication',
    ],
}
```
- urls.py:
``` from django.urls import path
from rest_framework_simplejwt import views as jwt_views

urlpatterns = [
    # Your URLs...
    path('api/token/', jwt_views.TokenObtainPairView.as_view(), name='token_obtain_pair'),
    path('api/token/refresh/', jwt_views.TokenRefreshView.as_view(), name='token_refresh'),
]
```
### [Django Runserver Is Not Your Production Server](https://build.vsupalov.com/django-runserver-in-production/)
- If your new to Django or still earlier stage of developing, you've probably been using `python manage.py runserver`. Although that a good command for development purposes, it not meant to be used as part of a production setup.
- What's the right way to approach this?
  * > When a request arrives at your server, it should be passed to a dedicated web server. Nginx is an example for a good web server. When a request arrives at your server, it should be passed to a dedicated web server. Nginx is an example for a good web server.
  * > The next component is an application server. It gets those fancy requests and uses them to construct Python objects which are usable by Django. WSGI is a specification which people agreed on, which describe how that happens. Gunicorn is an example for a WSGI server.
- How does Django fit in?
  * > Your project provides a uwsgi.py file, which contains a function to be called by the application server. This function gets a Python object representing the incoming request.
    * This function calls your code, and produces a response object which is passed to the WSGI server. There the response is translated into a HTTP response and is passed back to the web server, which finally delivers it to the user.
