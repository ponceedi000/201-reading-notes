- [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/): 
  * Is a powerful Python module for machine learning
  * Provides simple/efficient tools for predective data analysis
  * It is built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib
  * MOST IMPORT: It's Open Source (BSD License)!!!
- `sklearn.linear_model module`
  * contains "methods intended for regressing in which the target value is expected to be a linear combination of the input variables"
- If you want to look inside the linear regression object, you can do so by typing `LinearRegression` and use tab to use the specific function you'd like inside of IDE.
- Important functions to keep in mind while fitting a linear regression model are:
  1. `lm.fit()` -> fits a linear model
  2. `lm.predict()` -> Predict Y using the linear model with estimated coefficients
  3. `lm.score()` -> Returns the coefficient of determination (R^2). A measure of how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model, as the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model.
  4. `get_params()`-> Gets parameters of estimator
  5. `set_params()`-> Sets parameters of estimator
- `.coef_` gives the coefficients and `.intercept_` gives the estimated intercepts.
- Residual Plots
  * > "Residual plots are a good way to visualize the errors in your data. If you have done a good job then your data should be randomly scattered around line zero. If you see structure in your data, that means your model is not capturing some thing. Maye be there is a interaction between 2 variables that you are not considering, or may be you are measuring time dependent data. If you get some structure in your data, you should go back to your model and check whether you are doing a good job with your parameters." - Manu Jeevan
