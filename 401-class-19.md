### [Python Regular Expressions Tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/python-regular-expression-tutorial)
- What is regex?
  * Regular Expressions are a sequence of characters used to check whether a pattern exists in a given text (string) or not.
- Examples of use cases:
  * They are used at the server side to validate the format of email addresses or passwords during registration
  * They are used for parsing text data files to find, replace, or delete certain string, etc.
  * They help in manipulating textual data, which is often a prerequisite for data science projects involving text mining.
- To use the re library, use 'import re' in your Python file to run module
- **Basic Patterns: Ordinary Characters**
  * Ordinary characters are the simplest regex's as they match themselves EXACTLY and do NOT have a special meaning in their regex syntax
  * EX:
```
pattern = r"Cookie"
sequence = "Cookie"
if re.match(pattern, sequence):
    print("Match!")
else: print("Not a match!")

Output// Match!
```
- The `match()` function returns a match object if the text matches the pattern
  * If not found, it returns `None`
- The `r` at the start of the pattern is called a **raw string literal**
- **Wild Card Characters: Special Characters**
- `search()`: With the search function, you scan through the given string/sequence, looking for the first location where the regular expression produces a match.
- `group()`: The group function returns the string matched by the re.
- `.`: A period. Matches any single character except the newline character.
```
re.search(r'Co.k.e', 'Cookie').group()
Output// 'Cookie'
```
- `^`:  A caret. Matches the start of the string.
```
re.search(r'^Eat', "Eat cake!").group()

Output// 'Eat'
```
