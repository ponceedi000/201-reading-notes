### [Python Regular Expressions Tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/python-regular-expression-tutorial)
- What is regex?
  * Regular Expressions are a sequence of characters used to check whether a pattern exists in a given text (string) or not.
- Examples of use cases:
  * They are used at the server side to validate the format of email addresses or passwords during registration
  * They are used for parsing text data files to find, replace, or delete certain string, etc.
  * They help in manipulating textual data, which is often a prerequisite for data science projects involving text mining.
- To use the re library, use 'import re' in your Python file to run module
- **Basic Patterns: Ordinary Characters**
  * Ordinary characters are the simplest regex's as they match themselves EXACTLY and do NOT have a special meaning in their regex syntax
  * EX:
```
pattern = r"Cookie"
sequence = "Cookie"
if re.match(pattern, sequence):
    print("Match!")
else: print("Not a match!")

Output// Match!
```
- The `match()` function returns a match object if the text matches the pattern
  * If not found, it returns `None`
- The `r` at the start of the pattern is called a **raw string literal**
#### **Wild Card Characters: Special Characters**
- `search()`: With the search function, you scan through the given string/sequence, looking for the first location where the regular expression produces a match.
- `group()`: The group function returns the string matched by the re.
- `.`: A period. Matches any single character except the newline character.
```
re.search(r'Co.k.e', 'Cookie').group()
Output// 'Cookie'
```
- `^`:  A caret. Matches the start of the string.
  * > This is helpful if you want to make sure a document/sentence starts with certain characters.
```
re.search(r'^Eat', "Eat cake!").group()

Output// 'Eat'
```
- `$`: Matches the end of string.
  * > This is helpful if you want to make sure a document/sentence ends with certain characters.
```
re.search(r'cake$', "Cake! Let's eat cake").group()

## The next search will return the NONE value, try it:
# re.search(r'cake$', "Let's get some cake on our way home!").group()
'cake'
```
- `[abc]`: Matches a or b or c
- `[a-zA-Z0-9]`: Matches any letter from (a to z) or (A to Z) or (0 to 9).
  * Characters that are not within a range can be matched by complementing the set. If the first character of the set is ^, all the characters that are not in the set will be matched.
```
re.search(r'[0-6]', 'Number: 5').group()
Output// '5'
## Matches any character except 5
re.search(r'Number: [^5]', 'Number: 0').group()

## This will not match and hence a NONE value will be returned
#re.search(r'Number: [^5]', 'Number: 5').group()
Output// 'Number: 0'
```
#### **Greedy vs. Non-Greedy Matching**
  * > When a special character matches as much of the search sequence (string) as possible, it is said to be a "Greedy Match". It is the normal behavior of a regular expression, but sometimes this behavior is not desired

- Summary table
- `.`	A period. Matches any single character except the newline character.
- `^`	A caret. Matches a pattern at the start of the string.
- `\A`	Uppercase A. Matches only at the start of the string.
- `$`	Dollar sign. Matches the end of the string.
- `\Z`	Uppercase Z. Matches only at the end of the string.
- `[ ]`	Matches the set of characters you specify within it.
- `\` 
  * If the character following the backslash is a recognized escape character, then the special meaning of the term is taken.
  * Else the backslash () is treated like any other character and passed through.
  * It can be used in front of all the metacharacters to remove their special meaning.
- `\w`	Lowercase w. Matches any single letter, digit, or underscore.
- `\W`	Uppercase W. Matches any character not part of \w (lowercase w).
- `\s`	Lowercase s. Matches a single whitespace character like: space, newline, tab, return.
- `\S`	Uppercase S. Matches any character not part of \s (lowercase s).
- `\d`	Lowercase d. Matches decimal digit 0-9.
- `\D`	Uppercase D. Matches any character that is not a decimal digit.
- `\t`	Lowercase t. Matches tab.
- `\n`	Lowercase n. Matches newline.
- `\r`	Lowercase r. Matches return.
- `\b`	Lowercase b. Matches only the beginning or end of the word.
- `+`	Checks if the preceding character appears one or more times.
- `*`	Checks if the preceding character appears zero or more times.
- `?`
  * Checks if the preceding character appears exactly zero or one time.
  * Specifies a non-greedy version of +, *
- `{ }`	Checks for an explicit number of times.
- `( )`	Creates a group when performing matches.
- `< >`	Creates a named group when performing matches.
#### **A few of many functions provided by 're'**
- `start()` - Returns the starting index of the match.
- `end()` - Returns the index where the match ends.
- `span()` - Return a tuple containing the (start, end) positions of the match.
- `match()`: function checks for a match only at the beginning of the string (by default)
- `search()`: function checks for a match anywhere in the string
#### Compilation Flags
- IGNORECASE (I) - Allows case-insensitive matches.
- DOTALL (S) - Allows . to match any character, including newline.
- MULTILINE (M) - Allows start of string (^) and end of string ($) anchor to match newlines as well.
- VERBOSE (X) - Allows you to write whitespace and comments within a regular expression to make it more readable.
