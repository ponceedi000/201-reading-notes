### [Python Scope](https://realpython.com/python-scope-legb-rule/)

- What is scope?
  * The concept of scope rules how variables and names are looked up in your code. It determines the visibility of a variable within the code. The scope of a name or variable depends on the place in your code where you create that variable. The Python scope concept is generally presented using a rule known as the LEGB rule.
  * LEGB = Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in scopes.
- **Global Scope**:
  * > "The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code"
  * Fun fact: Scope originaeted from early programming languages such as BASIC which only had global names. This in turn caused negative effects debugging a nd maintaing large programs
  * > "Global (or module) scope is the top-most scope in a Python program, script, or module. This Python scope contains all of the names that you define at the top level of a program or a module. Names in this Python scope are visible from everywhere in your code."
  * Note: As soon as you starts a Python program, you're automatically in the global Python Scope. Behind the scenes, Python is turns your programs main script into a module known as __main__ to execute your main file.
- **Nonlocal**
  * > Enclosing (or nonlocal) scope is a special scope that only exists for nested functions. If the local scope is an inner or nested function, then the enclosing scope is the scope of the outer or enclosing function. This scope contains the names that you define in the enclosing function. The names in the enclosing scope are visible from the code of the inner and enclosing functions.
  * EX:
```
def outer_func():
...     # This block is the Local scope of outer_func()
...     var = 100  # A nonlocal var
...     # It's also the enclosing scope of inner_func()
...     def inner_func():
...         # This block is the Local scope of inner_func()
...         print(f"Printing var from inner_func(): {var}")
...
...     inner_func()
...     print(f"Printing var from outer_func(): {var}")
...
>>> outer_func()
Printing var from inner_func(): 100
Printing var from outer_func(): 100
>>> inner_func()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'inner_func' is not defined
```
  * Imprtant note: You cannot modify names in the enclosing scope from inside a nested function unless you declare them as ***nonlocal*** within the nested function.
  * The nonlocal Statement: "Just like global names, nonlocalnames can be accessed from inner functions, but now assigned or updated."
    * IOT modify them, you have to use the ***nonlocal statement***
 EX:
 ```
 >>> def func():
...     var = 100  # A nonlocal variable
...     def nested():
...         nonlocal var  # Declare var as nonlocal
...         var += 100
...
...     nested()
...     print(var)
...
>>> func()
```
