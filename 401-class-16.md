### [What is Serverless Computing](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/serverless)
- **Serverless: Serverless is a cloud execution model that enables a simpler, more cost-effective way to build and operate cloud-native applications.**
- It is a cloud computing execution model that:
  * > Automatically provisions the computing resources required to run application code on demand, or in response to a specific event;
  * > Automatically scales those resources up or down in response to increased or decreased demand;
  * > Automatically scales resources to zero when the application stops running. 

- **Pros (Takeaways):**
  * > serverless enables development teams to focus on writing code, not managing infrastructure. It gives developers much more time to innovate and optimize their front-end application functionality and business logic.
    * I can see this being super helpful. As a more fron-end oriented developer, I see this being crucial.
  * > Serverless is a polyglot environment, enabling developers to code in any language or framework - Java, Python, node.js - with which they're comfortable.
  * > Serverless simplifies deployment and, in a larger sense, simplifies DevOps cycles, because developers don't have to describe infrastructure needed integrate, test, deliver and deploy code builds into production.
  * > For certain workloads, such as ones that require parallel processing, serverless can be both faster and more cost-effective than other forms of compute.
    * Sounds to me this saves money and time for both parties (your company and their customers).

- **Cons (Takeaways):**
- > Stable or predictable workloads: Because serverless scales up and down on demand in response to workload, it offers significant cost savings for spiky workloads.
- > Cold starts: Because serverless architectures forgo long-running processes in favor of scaling up and down to zero, they also sometimes need to start up from zero to serve a new request.
  * This could be an issue if dealing with time sensitive programs such as financial trading
- > onitoring and debugging: These operational tasks are challenging in any distributed system, but a move serverless architecture (or microservices architecture, or a combination of the two) only exacerbates the complexity.


When should we use serverless?
- A common use case is to support microservices architectures
- Backend API's: Any action (or function) in a serverless platform can be turned into a HTTP endpoint ready to be consumed by web clients. 
- Data Processing: "Serverless is well-suited to working with structured text, audio, image, and video data, around tasks such as data enrichment, transformation, validation, cleansing; PDF processing; audio normalization; image processing (rotation, sharpening, noise reduction, thumbnail generation); optical character recognition (OCR); and video transcoding."
- Massively parallel compute/“Map” operations
- Stream processing workloads
- Common applications
