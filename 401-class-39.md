## Readings: React 2
***

### [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/getting-started)

- Building a web application from scratch using React involves many important details to consider:
  * Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
  * You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
  * You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
  * You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.

- Next.js: The React Framework provides a solution to all of the above bullet points
- Next.js aims to have best-in-class developer experience and many built-in features, such as:
  * An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes)
  * Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
  * Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
  * Client-side routing with optimized prefetching
  * Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library
  * Development environment with Fast Refresh support
  * API routes to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions
  * Fully extendable

- This is the starter template page which shows some helpful information about Next.js.

- Link Component
  * When linking between pages on websites, you use the <a> HTML tag.
  * In Next.js, you use the Link Component from next/link to wrap the <a> tag. <Link> allows you to do client-side navigation to a different page in the application.
```
 import Link from 'next/link'
 
 <h1 className="title">
  Read{' '}
  <Link href="/posts/first-post">
    <a>this page!</a>
  </Link>
</h1>
 // {' '} adds an empty space, which is used to divide text over multiple lines.
 ```
- > Next.js automatically optimizes your application for the best performance by code splitting, client-side navigation, and prefetching (in production). You create routes as files under pages and use the built-in Link component. No routing libraries are required.
 
 - Assets
  * Next.js can serve static assets, like images, under the top-level public directory. Files inside public can be referenced from the root of the application similar to pages.
  * The public directory is also useful for robots.txt, Google Site Verification, and any other static assets. Check out the documentation for Static File Serving to learn more.
 
 - Using the Image Component
```
 import Image from 'next/image'

const YourComponent = () => (
  <Image
    src="/images/profile.jpg" // Route of the image file
    height={144} // Desired size with correct aspect ratio
    width={144} // Desired size with correct aspect ratio
    alt="Your Name"
  />
)
 ```
 
 - Writing and Importing CSS
  * Next.js has built-in support for CSS and Sass which allows you to import .css and .scss files.
  * Using popular CSS libraries like Tailwind CSS is also supported.
