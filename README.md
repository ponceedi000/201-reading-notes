# Reading Notes

This is my reading notes repo to track all of my reading notes.

## About Me
My name is Eddie. I am a *student* at **CodeFellows.**
I recently seperated from the U.S Marine Corps and decided to transition into the tech industry simply because I am beyond fascinated with it all. A quote I like to live by is: `"Don't limit your challenges, challenge your limits." -Tony Robbins`
