### Chapter 4: Ch.4 “Links” (pp.74-93) -From the Duckett HTML book
- > "links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another - enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing." -Duckett
- Some important jobs of links:
  * Used to surf from one website to another
  * Move from one page to another on same website
  * Move from one part of a webpage to another part of the same webpage
  * links that open in new browser window
  * Links that start up your email program and address a new email to someone
- Writing Links: You create links using the `<a>` element (open/close). You then specify which page you want to link with an `href` attribute. Example: `<a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>`. Notice the text between tags-this is the test that will render on a webpage with the link embedded into it. This specific link will take you to another website.
- When linking another webpage on your website, you do not need the domain name; you would use a what's called a Relative URL. This means you use your direcotry structure to link your pages; Example: `<a href="music/listings.html">Listings</a>` -Duckett.
- For the rest of the other link types, the syntax remains mostly similar. It's an easy google search if you ever forget it.

  * Controlling the position of elements
