## Readings: React and Forms
***
### [React Docs - Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
- What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?
  * The single-responsibility principle (SRP) is a computer-programming principle that states that every module, class or function in a computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality, and it should encapsulate that part. 
  * A component should usually do only one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.
- What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?
  * To build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you’ll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using props.
- Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
  * You need to either deploy your static site or continue working on it to become an interactive site?
- What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?
  * > Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
  * > Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
  * > Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.
- How can you identify where state needs to live?
  * > If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.

### [Higher-Order Functions](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html#h_xxCc98lOBK)
- What is a “higher-order function”?
  * Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions.
- Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?
  * Returning a new function i believe.
- Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.
  * > The higher-order operation that represents this pattern is called reduce (sometimes also called fold). It builds a value by repeatedly taking a single element from the array and combining it with the current value. When summing numbers, you’d start with the number zero and, for each element, add that to the sum.
  * > The map method transforms an array by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new array from the returned values. The new array will have the same length as the input array, but its content will have been mapped to a new form by the function.
