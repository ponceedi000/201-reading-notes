## Readings: React and Forms

### [React Docs - Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
- What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?
  * The single-responsibility principle (SRP) is a computer-programming principle that states that every module, class or function in a computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality, and it should encapsulate that part. 
  * A component should usually do only one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.
- What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?
  * To build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you’ll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using props.
- Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
  * You need to either deploy your static site or continue working on it to become an interactive site?
- What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?
  * > Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
  * > Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
  * > Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.
- How can you identify where state needs to live?
