### [SQL vs NoSQL Database Differences](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)
- Five key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
  * SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
  * SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
  * QL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.
  * SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb
  * or complex queries: SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries. On a high-level, NoSQL don’t have standard interfaces to perform complex queries, and the queries themselves in NoSQL are not as powerful as SQL query language.
- What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
  * SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries.
- Give a real world example.
  * > NoSQL databases do a better job at representing real world objects.
- Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
  * NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.
- Which type of database is best for scalability?
  *  In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server.
