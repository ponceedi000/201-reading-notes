### [SQL vs NoSQL Database Differences](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)
- Five key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
  * SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
  * SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
  * QL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.
  * SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb
  * or complex queries: SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries. On a high-level, NoSQL don’t have standard interfaces to perform complex queries, and the queries themselves in NoSQL are not as powerful as SQL query language.
- What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
  * SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries.
- Give a real world example.
  * > NoSQL databases do a better job at representing real world objects.
- Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
  * NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.
- Which type of database is best for scalability?
  *  In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server.

- What does SQL stand for?
  * Structured Query Language
- What is a realational database?
  * A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.
- What type of structure does a relational database work with?
  * The relational database model was designed to solve the problem of multiple arbitrary data structures.
- What is a ‘schema’?
  * The database schema is its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system. The term "schema" refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed.
- What is a NoSQL database?
  * A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.
- How does it work?
  * The major purpose of using a NoSQL database is for distributed data stores with humongous data storage needs. NoSQL is used for Big data and real-time web apps. For example, companies like Twitter, Facebook and Google collect terabytes of user data every single day.

- What is inside of a Mongo database?
  * In MongoDB, data is stored as documents. These documents are stored in MongoDB in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. JSON documents support embedded fields, so related data and lists of data can be stored with the document instead of an external table.

- Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
  * While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions.
- What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
  * NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID).
