### [Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice](https://web.archive.org/web/20160616225417/http://www.happybearsoftware.com/upgrade-your-technical-skills-with-deliberate-practice)

- > Improving your hard technical skills makes all the software you build better. It exposes you to new opportunities, expands your knowledge into multiple fields and ultimately allows you to do more things with computers.
- What is deliberate practice?
  * > Activities designed, typically by a teacher, for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individualâ€™s performance.
- Key idea behind deliberate practice;
  * Pushes you just outside your comfort zone
  * Repeated often
  * Feedback on results in continuously available
  * It's highly demanding mentally
  * It's difficult
  * It requires good goals
#### Summary:
- Although coding everyday is beneficial, coding in your comfort zone will always limit who you are as a Developer. It's important to self reflect everyday and identify where you could improve!

### [Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en)

- Failure Grade V.S. Not Yet Grade
  * The way we use words and terminology in accordanance with the General Education System can actually cause negative or positive physcological affects.
    * Instead telling a student they failed, try telling them they haven't solved it ***yet***!
- Praising Yet
  * > Praising the process that kids engage in, their effort strategies, their focus, the perseverance, their improvement.
  
  
### [Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance)

- What is Grit? Grit is:
  * Passion and perseverance for very long-term goals
  * Having stamina
  * Sticking with your future, day in, day out
  * Living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint
- Chicago Public School Interesting statistics:
  * Grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate regardless of home income, family situations, or other common variables.
- How does one aquire grit?
  * No one really knows...


### [Alain de Botton on Redefining Success.](https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success)

- My Favorite quotes from Alain de Botton:
  * > "... and when you can't relate to somebody, you dont envy them... The closer two people are -- in age, in background, in the process of identification -- the more there's a danger of envy."
  * > "... hold your horses when you;re coming to judge people. You don't necessarily know what someone's true value is. That is an unknown part of them, and we shouldn't behave as though it is known."
  * > "...Let's make sure our ideas of success are truly our own."
In summary, stay true to yourself. Don't let other deviate from your own path to your success. BUT, you also want to avoid traveling the wrong path to begin with; make sure it is you that wants what you want.
