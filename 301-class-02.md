### [React: Component Lifecycle Events](https://medium.com/@joshuablankenshipnola/react-component-lifecycle-events-cb77e670a093) - Joshua Blakenship
- Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?
  * render
- What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
  * > Mounting: " When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM it occurs during the mounting phase. Constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount, and UNSAFE_componentWillMount all occur in this order during mounting. "  - Joshua Blakenship
- Put the following things in the order that they happen:
  * constructor
  * render
  * componentDidMount
  * React Updates
  * componentWillUnmount
  
- What does componentDidMount do?
  * > This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, don’t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().
setState() can be called here, but it should be used sparingly, because it will cause a rerender, which can lead to perfomance issues.
