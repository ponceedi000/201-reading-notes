## Readings : Images, Color, Text

### Chapter 5: “Images” (pp.94-125) -From the Duckett HTML book
- This chapter covered how to add images to pages, choose the right format, and how to optimize images for the web.
- Pictures are worth a hundred words; so they say. It goes without saying that images are an important tool to create a great experience for you users. 
  * > ... you might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram or chart... Images should be relevant, convey information, convey the right mood, be instantly recognisable, fit the color palette.- Jon Duckett
- In **HTML**, you want to create a folder within your project dedicated to images for easy access (have a clean file directory).
- Adding images is done with an `<img>` element. `src` tells the browser where it can find the file to the image. `alt` provides a text description of the image in a situation where a user can't see the image. `title` also provides addtional information about the image, specifically when you hoever over the image! A full example would look like this: `<image src="images/guitar.jpg" alt="Fender Strat" title="Fender's most sold guitar is the stratocaster model"/>`.
- Though it's better to style your elements with CSS, you can adjust height & width with HTML by using `width="123* height="123"` inside of your img tag. Deciding where to place an image in your HTML is important for your layout. For example, you can place an image before a paragraph, inside the start of a paragraph, or in the middle of a paraghraph which all have different affects of how it is rendered in the broswers. You used to be able to align your image in old HTML code but that is no longer supported with HTML5; you can do this with CSS instead.
- If you're a front end developer or UX/UI developer, it's important to know your differnt image formats such as GIF and PNG. Both files are used for paticular reasons depending on the type of image you are using. An example of a GIF would be a 'loading' animation. 
  * >  Like GIF images, PNG also have the ability to display transparent backgrounds. In addition to that, PNG files are capable of containing 24bit RGB color palettes and greyscale images. - www.paintshoppro.com
