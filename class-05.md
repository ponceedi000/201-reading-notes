## Readings : Images, Color, Text

### Chapter 5: “Images” (pp.94-125) -From the Duckett HTML book
- This chapter covered how to add images to pages, choose the right format, and how to optimize images for the web.
- Pictures are worth a hundred words; so they say. It goes without saying that images are an important tool to create a great experience for you users. 
  * > ... you might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram or chart... Images should be relevant, convey information, convey the right mood, be instantly recognisable, fit the color palette.- Jon Duckett
- In **HTML**, you want to create a folder within your project dedicated to images for easy access (have a clean file directory).
- Adding images is done with an `<img>` element. `src` tells the browser where it can find the file to the image. `alt` provides a text description of the image in a situation where a user can't see the image. `title` also provides addtional information about the image, specifically when you hoever over the image! A full example would look like this: `<image src="images/guitar.jpg" alt="Fender Strat" title="Fender's most sold guitar is the stratocaster model"/>`
