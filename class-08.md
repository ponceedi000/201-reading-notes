## Readings : CSS Layout Cont'd

### HTML/CSS book, Ch. 15, “Layout” (again; repeat of Class 4 reading) - From the Duckett HTML book
- Understanding how to create a responsive website for all screen sizes is highly important during this present time. People are using phones, tablets, laptops, desktops with various sized screens, and even more. You simply cannot code your CSS that works only on your screen if your wanting to create oustanding UX/UI.
  * > Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens - Duckett
  * Screen Resolution referes to number of pixels a screen shows per inch. Of note, the higher the resolution the smaller the text.
  * Page sizes: Duckett states that "Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers ofter try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide (since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens)"
 - Some new layouts:
   * Fixed Width Layouts: this design does not change the size as the user increases/decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels
   * Liquid Layouts: this design stretches and contracts as the user increases/'decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.
 - > CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can inlude the CSS framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.
   * There are many advantages/disadvantages to using CSS frameworks. Sometimes certain tech companies will require that you use frameworks when working on projects and vise versa.
   * Here are some pretty popular frameworks that I looked up on google: [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [ZURB Foundation](https://get.foundation/), [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), [Ulkit](https://getuikit.com/), and [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/).
   * These can be some pretty great tools to utilze for making advanced design but of course, each framework has some learning curves to overcome initially.
 - Lastly, you may come across some authors that prefer to use multiple style sheets to control their webpage such as: they might use one stylesheet to control the layout and another to control fonts, and then colors and so on. This easily done by ensuring you link your CSS files to your HTML page(s).
