### [How to use Random Module](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/random/how-to-use-the-random-module-in-python)
- The random module gives us access to a number of functions that supports many types of operations. The most important or most common thing is that it allows you to generate random numbers.
- When do we use it?
  * Most developers have come accross a situation where they needed to generte a random value. Where it be a simple rock/paper/scissors game or something more complex, random numbers can be very useful for developing.
### Useful Random Functions: [pythonforbeginners.com](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/random/how-to-use-the-random-module-in-python)
- Randint: If we wanted a random integer, we can use the randint function Randint accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number. Generate integers between 1,5. The first value should be less than the second.
```
import random
print random.randint(0, 5)
This will output either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.
```
Random: If we want a larger number, you can multiply it.
EX: Random number from 0 and 100
```
import random
random.random() * 100
```
Choice: Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.
EX: The choice function can often be used for choosing a random element from a list.
```
import random
myList = [2, 109, False, 10, "Lorem", 482, "Ipsum"]
random.choice(myList)
```
Shuffle: The shuffle function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.
EX: random.shuffle(list) Example taken from this post on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/976882/shuffling-a-list-of-objects-in-python)
```
from random import shuffle
x = [[i] for i in range(10)]
shuffle(x)
Output:
# print x  gives  [[9], [2], [7], [0], [4], [5], [3], [1], [8], [6]]
# of course your results will vary
```
Randrange: Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)
EX: random.shuffle(list) Example taken from this post on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/976882/shuffling-a-list-of-objects-in-python)
```
random.randrange(start, stop[, step])
import random
for i in range(3):
    print random.randrange(0, 101, 5)
```


### [What is Risk Analysis](https://www.edureka.co/blog/risk-analysis-in-software-testing/)
- > "In Software Testing, risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test. After that, the process of assigning the level of risk is done." - Anamkia
- Why use Risk Analysis (RA)?
  * Using RA in the beginning of a project can help highlight the potention problem areas. This can help developers mitigate said risk as they code.
- What kind of risks may someone encounter?
  1. Use of new hardware
  2. Use of new technology
  3. Use of new automation tool
  4. The sequence of code
  5. Availability of test resources for the application

- How to perform Risk Analysis?
  * Searching the risk
  * Analyzing the impact of each individual risk
  * Measures for the risk identified
### [Test Coverage](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestCoverage.html)
- > "Like most aspects of programming, testing requires thoughtfulness. TDD is a very useful, but certainly not sufficient, tool to help you get good tests. If you are testing thoughtfully and well, I would expect a coverage percentage in the upper 80s or 90s. I would be suspicious of anything like 100% - it would smell of someone writing tests to make the coverage numbers happy, but not thinking about what they are doing."
- Personal Notes:
  * It makes sense that most devs focus on coverage numbers. The more tests, the more confident the team is about the product. But what if we wrote less tests that were more efficient? This is where TDD get very interesting in my opinion!
- How to know you've done enough testing:
  * > "You rarely get bugs that escape into production, and
  * > "You are rarely hesitant to change some code for fear it will cause production bugs." - Martin Fowler
