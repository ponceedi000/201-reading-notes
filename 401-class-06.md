### [How to use Random Module](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/random/how-to-use-the-random-module-in-python)
- The random module gives us access to a number of functions that supports many types of operations. The most important or most common thing is that it allows you to generate random numbers.
- When do we use it?
  * Most developers have come accross a situation where they needed to generte a random value. Where it be a simple rock/paper/scissors game or something more complex, random numbers can be very useful for developing.
### Useful Random Functions: [pythonforbeginners.com](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/random/how-to-use-the-random-module-in-python)
- Randint: If we wanted a random integer, we can use the randint function Randint accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number. Generate integers between 1,5. The first value should be less than the second.
```
import random
print random.randint(0, 5)
This will output either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.
```
Random: If we want a larger number, you can multiply it.
EX: Random number from 0 and 100
```
import random
random.random() * 100
```
Choice: Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.
EX: The choice function can often be used for choosing a random element from a list.
```
import random
myList = [2, 109, False, 10, "Lorem", 482, "Ipsum"]
random.choice(myList)
```
Shuffle: The shuffle function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.
EX: random.shuffle(list) Example taken from this post on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/976882/shuffling-a-list-of-objects-in-python)
```
from random import shuffle
x = [[i] for i in range(10)]
shuffle(x)
Output:
# print x  gives  [[9], [2], [7], [0], [4], [5], [3], [1], [8], [6]]
# of course your results will vary
```
Randrange: Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)
EX: random.shuffle(list) Example taken from this post on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/976882/shuffling-a-list-of-objects-in-python)
```
random.randrange(start, stop[, step])
import random
for i in range(3):
    print random.randrange(0, 101, 5)
```
