## Readings: Classes, Objects, Recursion, Pytest
***

### [Classes and Objects](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects)
- Ehat are classes and Objects?
  * > "Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects."
  * EX:
```
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")
```
- Accessing Object Variables
  * If you want to access a variable inside of your new object, you would do the following:
```
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

myobjectx.variable
```
- Accessing Object Functions
  * Similar to accessing a variable within an object:
```
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

myobjectx.function()
```
- init()
  * > "The `__init__()` function, is a special function that is called when the class is being initiated. It's used for asigning values in a class."
### [Thinking Recursively](https://realpython.com/python-thinking-recursively/)
- Recursive Functions in Python
  * > " A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions. This means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result. All recursive functions share a common structure made up of two parts: base case and recursive case."
- Maintaining State
  * > "When dealing with recursive functions, keep in mind that each recursive call has its own execution context, so to maintain state during recursion you have to either:"
    * Thread the state through each recursive call so that the current state is part of the current call’s execution context
    * Keep the state in global scope
- Recursive Data Structures in Python
  * A data structure is recursive if it can be deﬁned in terms of a smaller version of itself. A list is an example of a recursive data structure.
- Pesky Details
  * Python doesn’t have support for [tail-call elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call). As a result, you can cause a stack overflow if you end up using more stack frames than the [default call stack depth](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/sys.html#sys.getrecursionlimit):
  * This is something you should keep in mind when building a pogram that requires **deep recursion**.
### [Pytest Fixtures and Coverage](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/python-testing-pytest-fixtures-and-coverage)
- Fixtures
  * When writing your tests, you will rarely only write just 1 or 2 tests. Instead, you will likely write an entire "test suite" for your code to ensure it works in every scenario. 
  * > In many cases, this means you'll have a few tests with similar characteristics, something that pytest handles with "parametrized tests".
  * In other cases, things are mosre complex and you'll want to have some objects available for all of your tests
  * Use `pytest.fixture` decorator to define fixtures.
  EX:
  ```def reverse_lines(f):
   return [one_line.rstrip()[::-1] + '\n'
           for one_line in f]
           ```
- Coverage
  * >" So, how can you include code coverage with pytest? It turns out that there's a package called pytest-cov on PyPI that you can download and install. Once that's done, you can invoke pytest with the --cov option. If you don't say anything more than that, you'll get a coverage report for every part of the Python library that your program used, so I strongly suggest you provide an argument to --cov, specifying which program(s) you want to test. And, you should indicate the directory into which the report should be written."
  * For example:
```
pytest --cov=mymul .
```
