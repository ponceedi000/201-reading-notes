- The 1st paragraph talks about a lady named Julia Rozovsky. She seeked a study group for help and instead of any positive outcome/gain, she ended up hating the Teams unprofessional dynamic. It was a major source of stress.
- > Today, on corporate campuses and within university laboratories, psychologists, sociologists and statisticians are devoting themselves to studying everything from team composition to email patterns in order to figure out how to make employees into faster, better and more productive versions of themselves.
  * > "We’re living through a golden age of understanding personal productivity," says Marshall Van Alstyne
