## ES6 Overview

### [ES6 Syntax and Feature Overview](https://www.taniarascia.com/es6-syntax-and-feature-overview/)

- ES6 is a topic i've learned in the past before, however this article is a great refresher after learning Python for the past 5 months.
- **Variables and constant feature comparison:**
  * `var`:
    * Scope: Function scope
    * Hoisting: Yes
    * Can be reassigned: Yes
    * Can be redeclared: Yes
  * `let`:
    * Scope: Block scope
    * Hoisting: No
    * Can be reassigned: Yes
    * Can be redeclared: No

  * `const`:
    * Scope: Block scope
    * Hoisting: No
    * Can be reassigned: No
    * Can be redeclared: No

- **Arrow functions:**
  * > The arrow function expression syntax is a shorter way of creating a function expression. Arrow functions do not have their own `this`, do not have prototypes, cannot be used for constructors, and should not be used as object methods.
  * Arrow function expression limitations:
    * Arrow functions don't have their own bindings to `this` or `super`, and should not be used as `methods`.
    * Arrow functions don't have access to the `new.target` keyword.
    * Arrow functions aren't suitable for `call`, `apply` and `bind` methods, which generally rely on establishing a scope.
    * Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors.
    * Arrow functions cannot use `yield`, within its body.
  * ES5 ex: `function func(a, b, c) {} // function declaration`
  * ES6 ex: `let func = (a, b, c) => {} // parentheses required with multiple parameters`
- Implicit Returns: The `return` keyword is implied and can be omitted if using arrow functions without a block body.
ES5 EX:
```
function func(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c
}
```
ES6 Ex:
`let func = (a, b, c) => a + b + c // curly brackets must be omitted`

- **Array iteration (looping)**: A more concise syntax has been introduced for iteration through arrays and other iterable objects.
ES5 Ex:
```
for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  console.log(arr[i])
}
```
ES6 Ex:
```
for (let i of arr) {
  console.log(i)
}
```

*There are many more differences between ES5 and ES6, I'll definetly need to refer back to this article if a situation dictates to.*

## React

### [React - Hello World](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)

- The smallest React example looks like this: It displays a heading saying “Hello, world!” on the page.
```ReactDOM
  .createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
  .render(<h1>Hello, world!</h1>);
```

### [React - JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)

- **What is JSX?**
  * JSX stands for JavaScript XML
  * JSX allows us to write HTML in React
  * JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React
  * SX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any `createElement()`  and/or `appendChild()` methods.
  * JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.
- Is it required to use JSX w/ React?
  * No, but JSX makes it easier to write React applications
- Why JSX?
  * > React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

- **Embedding Expressions in JSX**
EX: 
```const name = 'Josh Perez';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
```
- **JSX is an Expression Too**
  * > After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects. This means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions:
```
function getGreeting(user) {
  if (user) {
    return <h1>Hello, {formatName(user)}!</h1>;
  }
  return <h1>Hello, Stranger.</h1>;
}

```
- **Specifying Attributes with JSX: **
You may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes:
`const element = <a href="https://www.reactjs.org"> link </a>;`
Or you can use curly braces to embed a JS expression in an attribute:
`const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl}></img>;`

- J**SX Represents Objects: babel compiles JSX down to `React.createElement()`calls.**

```
const element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world!'
  }
};
```



### [React - Rendering Elements](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html)

- > Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.
- **Rendering an Element into the DOM**
  * To render a React element, first pass the DOM element to ReactDOM.createRoot(), then pass the React element to root.render():
  * Assuming you have a `div` in your html file with the id of "root":
```
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById('root')
);
root.render(element);
```
- IMPORTANT NOTE: React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time. React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.



### [React - Components & Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)

- What are components?
  * > Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.
- Function Components:
Ex:
```
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```
  * We call this component a function component because it is regular JavaScript function. 
  * This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element.

- ES6 class to define a component
```
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

- Rendering a Component:
  * When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes and children to this component as a single object. We call this object “props”.
```
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(element);
```
