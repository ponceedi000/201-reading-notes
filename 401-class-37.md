## ES6 Overview

### [ES6 Syntax and Feature Overview](https://www.taniarascia.com/es6-syntax-and-feature-overview/)

- ES6 is a topic i've learned in the past before, however this article is a great refresher after learning Python for the past 5 months.
- **Variables and constant feature comparison:**
  * `var`:
    * Scope: Function scope
    * Hoisting: Yes
    * Can be reassigned: Yes
    * Can be redeclared: Yes
  * `let`:
    * Scope: Block scope
    * Hoisting: No
    * Can be reassigned: Yes
    * Can be redeclared: No

  * `const`:
    * Scope: Block scope
    * Hoisting: No
    * Can be reassigned: No
    * Can be redeclared: No

- **Arrow functions:**
  * > The arrow function expression syntax is a shorter way of creating a function expression. Arrow functions do not have their own `this`, do not have prototypes, cannot be used for constructors, and should not be used as object methods.
  * Arrow function expression limitations:
    * Arrow functions don't have their own bindings to `this` or `super`, and should not be used as `methods`.
    * Arrow functions don't have access to the `new.target` keyword.
    * Arrow functions aren't suitable for `call`, `apply` and `bind` methods, which generally rely on establishing a scope.
    * Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors.
    * Arrow functions cannot use `yield`, within its body.
  * ES5 ex: `function func(a, b, c) {} // function declaration`
  * ES6 ex: `let func = (a, b, c) => {} // parentheses required with multiple parameters`
- Implicit Returns: The `return` keyword is implied and can be omitted if using arrow functions without a block body.
ES5 EX:
```
function func(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c
}
```
ES6 Ex:
`let func = (a, b, c) => a + b + c // curly brackets must be omitted`

- **Array iteration (looping)**: A more concise syntax has been introduced for iteration through arrays and other iterable objects.
ES5 Ex:
```
for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  console.log(arr[i])
}
```
ES6 Ex:
```
for (let i of arr) {
  console.log(i)
}
```
