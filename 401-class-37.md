## ES6 Overview

### [ES6 Syntax and Feature Overview](https://www.taniarascia.com/es6-syntax-and-feature-overview/)

- ES6 is a topic i've learned in the past before, however this article is a great refresher after learning Python for the past 5 months.
- **Variables and constant feature comparison:**
  * `var`:
    * Scope: Function scope
    * Hoisting: Yes
    * Can be reassigned: Yes
    * Can be redeclared: Yes
  * `let`:
    * Scope: Block scope
    * Hoisting: No
    * Can be reassigned: Yes
    * Can be redeclared: No

  * `const`:
    * Scope: Block scope
    * Hoisting: No
    * Can be reassigned: No
    * Can be redeclared: No

- **Arrow functions:**
  * > The arrow function expression syntax is a shorter way of creating a function expression. Arrow functions do not have their own `this`, do not have prototypes, cannot be used for constructors, and should not be used as object methods.
  * Arrow function expression limitations:
    * Arrow functions don't have their own bindings to `this` or `super`, and should not be used as `methods`.
    * Arrow functions don't have access to the `new.target` keyword.
    * Arrow functions aren't suitable for `call`, `apply` and `bind` methods, which generally rely on establishing a scope.
    * Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors.
    * Arrow functions cannot use `yield`, within its body.
  * ES5 ex: `function func(a, b, c) {} // function declaration`
  * ES6 ex: `let func = (a, b, c) => {} // parentheses required with multiple parameters`
- Implicit Returns: The `return` keyword is implied and can be omitted if using arrow functions without a block body.
ES5 EX:
```
function func(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c
}
```
ES6 Ex:
`let func = (a, b, c) => a + b + c // curly brackets must be omitted`

- **Array iteration (looping)**: A more concise syntax has been introduced for iteration through arrays and other iterable objects.
ES5 Ex:
```
for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  console.log(arr[i])
}
```
ES6 Ex:
```
for (let i of arr) {
  console.log(i)
}
```

*There are many more differences between ES5 and ES6, I'll definetly need to refer back to this article if a situation dictates to.*

## React

### [React - Hello World](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)

- The smallest React example looks like this: It displays a heading saying “Hello, world!” on the page.
```ReactDOM
  .createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
  .render(<h1>Hello, world!</h1>);
```

### [React - JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)

- **What is JSX?**
  * JSX stands for JavaScript XML
  * JSX allows us to write HTML in React
  * JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React
  * SX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any `createElement()`  and/or `appendChild()` methods.
  * JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.
- Is it required to use JSX w/ React?
  * No, but JSX makes it easier to write React applications
- Why JSX?
  * > React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

- **Embedding Expressions in JSX**
EX: 
```const name = 'Josh Perez';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
```
- **JSX is an Expression Too**
  * > After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects. This means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions:
```
function getGreeting(user) {
  if (user) {
    return <h1>Hello, {formatName(user)}!</h1>;
  }
  return <h1>Hello, Stranger.</h1>;
}

```
- **Specifying Attributes with JSX: **
You may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes:
`const element = <a href="https://www.reactjs.org"> link </a>;`
Or you can use curly braces to embed a JS expression in an attribute:
`const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl}></img>;`

- J**SX Represents Objects: babel compiles JSX down to `React.createElement()`calls.**

```
const element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world!'
  }
};
```



### [React - Rendering Elements](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html)

- > Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.
- **Rendering an Element into the DOM**
  * To render a React element, first pass the DOM element to ReactDOM.createRoot(), then pass the React element to root.render():
  * Assuming you have a `div` in your html file with the id of "root":
```
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById('root')
);
root.render(element);
```
- IMPORTANT NOTE: React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time. React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.



### [React - Components & Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)

- What are components?
  * > Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.
- Function Components:
Ex:
```
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```
  * We call this component a function component because it is regular JavaScript function. 
  * This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element.

- ES6 class to define a component
```
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

- Rendering a Component:
  * When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes and children to this component as a single object. We call this object “props”.
```
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(element);
```

- Props are Read-Only
  * > Whether you declare a component as a function or a class, it must never modify its own props. Consider this sum function:
  * **All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.**

### [React - State & Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)

- What is state?
  * > The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component. A component's state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders. - [simplelearn.com](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/reactjs-tutorial/reactjs-state)

- Converting a Function to a Class: You can convert a function component like Clock to a class in five steps:
  * Create an ES6 class, with the same name, that extends React.Component.
  * Add a single empty method to it called render().
  * Move the body of the function into the render() method.
  * Replace props with this.props in the render() body.
  * Delete the remaining empty function declaration.


### [React - Handling Events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)

- Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:
  * React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
  * With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
HTML EX:
```
<button onclick="activateLasers()">
  Activate Lasers
</button>
```
React EX:
```
<button onClick={activateLasers}>
  Activate Lasers
</button>
```
- > When using React, you generally don’t need to call addEventListener to add listeners to a DOM element after it is created. Instead, just provide a listener when the element is initially rendered. When you define a component using an ES6 class, a common pattern is for an event handler to be a method on the class. For example, this Toggle component renders a button that lets the user toggle between “ON” and “OFF” states:
```
class Toggle extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {isToggleOn: true};

    // This binding is necessary to make `this` work in the callback
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }

  handleClick() {
    this.setState(prevState => ({
      isToggleOn: !prevState.isToggleOn
    }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
        {this.state.isToggleOn ? 'ON' : 'OFF'}
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

## Tailwind CSS

### [Utility First CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first)


### [Tailwind in 15 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIuAyLZPH0)

- With Tailwind, you style elements by applying pre-existing classes directly in your HTML.
```
<div class="p-6 max-w-sm mx-auto bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg flex items-center space-x-4">
  <div class="shrink-0">
    <img class="h-12 w-12" src="/img/logo.svg" alt="ChitChat Logo">
  </div>
  <div>
    <div class="text-xl font-medium text-black">ChitChat</div>
    <p class="text-slate-500">You have a new message!</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
- The example above uses:
  * flexbox and padding to control overall card layout
  * max-width and margin to contrain the card with and center it horizontally
  * background color, border raidus, and box-shadow to style the cards appearance
  * width and height to size logo image
  * space-between to handle the spacing between the logo and text
  * dont size, text color, and font-weight to style card text
- Benefits of Tailwind:
  * **You aren’t wasting energy inventing class names.** No more adding silly class names like sidebar-inner-wrapper just to be able to style something, and no more agonizing over the perfect abstract name for something that’s really just a flex container.
  * **Your CSS stops growing.** Using a traditional approach, your CSS files get bigger every time you add a new feature. With utilities, everything is reusable so you rarely need to write new CSS.
  * **Making changes feels safer.** CSS is global and you never know what you’re breaking when you make a change. Classes in your HTML are local, so you can change them without worrying about something else breaking.

## Next.js

### [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app)

- What is Next.js?
  * > Quite simply, Next.js is a React framework for developing single page Javascript applications. The benefits of this framework are numerous, both for our clients’ applications as well as for our development team. The more we, as users, interact digitally, the more impatient we become as our expectations are not met by websites and apps that fail to load within milliseconds. Technology decisions play a large part in being able to deliver highly performant, scalable, successful applications and as such, we have started using Next.js for a number of reasons; for the most part related to speed and performance. - [clock](https://www.clock.co.uk/insight/next-js-what-is-it-and-why-do-we-use-it)

- Important details to consider when building a complete web application from scratch with Reac:
  * Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
  * You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
  * You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
  * You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.

- Next.js benefits:
  * An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes)
  * Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
  * Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
  * Client-side routing with optimized prefetching
  * Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library
  * Development environment with Fast Refresh support
  * API routes to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions
  * Fully extendable
