### [Pandas in 10](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html)

- Firstly, we need to use the correct imports. Industry Standard implementation is as followed:
  * `import numpy as np`
  * `import pandas as pd`
- We can create a `Series` by passing a list of values, letting pandas create a default integer index:
```
In [3]: s = pd.Series([1, 3, 5, np.nan, 6, 8])

In [4]: s
Out[4]: 
0    1.0
1    3.0
2    5.0
3    NaN
4    6.0
5    8.0
dtype: float64
```
- We can then create a `DataFrame` by passing a NumPy array, with a datetime index and labeled columns:
```
In [5]: dates = pd.date_range("20130101", periods=6)

In [6]: dates
Out[6]: 
DatetimeIndex(['2013-01-01', '2013-01-02', '2013-01-03', '2013-01-04',
               '2013-01-05', '2013-01-06'],
              dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq='D')

In [7]: df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(6, 4), index=dates, columns=list("ABCD"))
In [8]: df
Out[8]: 
                   A         B         C         D
2013-01-01  0.469112 -0.282863 -1.509059 -1.135632
2013-01-02  1.212112 -0.173215  0.119209 -1.044236
2013-01-03 -0.861849 -2.104569 -0.494929  1.071804
2013-01-04  0.721555 -0.706771 -1.039575  0.271860
2013-01-05 -0.424972  0.567020  0.276232 -1.087401
2013-01-06 -0.673690  0.113648 -1.478427  0.524988
```

- `DataFrame.to_numpy()`
  * This give a NumPy representation of the underlying data.
  * Of note, this can be an expensive operation what your `DataFrame` has columns with different data types
  * NumPy arrays have one dtype for the entire array, while pandas DataFrames have one dtype per column
  * When calling `DataFrame.to_numpy()`, pandas will find the NumPy dtype that can hold *all* of the dtypes in the DataFrame.
  * Sometimes this ends up being an object, which requires casting every value to a Python object
  * df = DataFrame
- `describe()`
  * shows a quick statistic summary of your data
- Setting
  * > Setting a new column automatically aligns the data by the indexes
- Missing data
  * pandas primarily uses the value `np.nan` to represent missing data. It is by default not included in computations.
- String Methods
  * Series is equipped with a set of string processing methods in the `str` attribute that make it easy to operate on each element of the array, as in the code snippet below.
  * Note that pattern-matching in `str` generally uses regular expressions by default (and in some cases always uses them).
- Concat 
  * > pandas provides various facilities for easily combining together Series and DataFrame objects with various kinds of set logic for the indexes and relational algebra functionality in the case of join / merge-type operations.
- Grouping: process involves one or more of the following steps:
  * **Splitting** the data into groups based on some criteria
  * **Applying** a function to each group independently
  * **Combining** the results into a data structure
- Time series
  * > pandas has simple, powerful, and efficient functionality for performing resampling operations during frequency conversion (e.g., converting secondly data into 5-minutely data). This is extremely common in, but not limited to, financial applications.
