### [Web Scrape with Python in 4 minutes](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-web-scrape-with-python-in-4-minutes-bc49186a8460)
- What is Web scraping?
  * > Web scraping is a technique to automatically access and extract large amounts of information from a website, which can save a huge amount of time and effort.
- Important Notes About Web Scraping:
  1. For legal purpose, read through the websites Terms and Conditions a find out how to legally use their data.
  2. Don't download data from a website at a rapid rate. This can potentially break the website or get you blocked.
- Inspecting a Website:
  * The inspect tool is our friend here.
  * Look through the HTML tags until you can locate the links to file we want to download

- Python Code
  * Imports:
```
import requests
import urllib.request
import time
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```
  * Next, we set the url to the website and access the site with our requests library.
```
url = 'http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html'
response = requests.get(url)
```
  * Next we parse the html with BeautifulSoup (library) so that we can work with a nicer, nested BeautifulSoup data structure.
`soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, “html.parser”)`
  * We use the method .findAll to locate all of our `<a>` tags.
`soup.findAll('a')`
  * Complete Code Example:
```
# Import libraries
import requests
import urllib.request
import time
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Set the URL you want to webscrape from
url = 'http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html'

# Connect to the URL
response = requests.get(url)

# Parse HTML and save to BeautifulSoup object¶
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")

# To download the whole data set, let's do a for loop through all a tags
line_count = 1 #variable to track what line you are on
for one_a_tag in soup.findAll('a'):  #'a' tags are for links
    if line_count >= 36: #code for text files starts at line 36
        link = one_a_tag['href']
        download_url = 'http://web.mta.info/developers/'+ link
        urllib.request.urlretrieve(download_url,'./'+link[link.find('/turnstile_')+1:]) 
        time.sleep(1) #pause the code for a sec
    #add 1 for next line
    line_count +=1
```

### [What is Web Scraping?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping)
- **Wikipedia Definition:** 
  * > Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. The web scraping software may directly access the World Wide Web using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis.
- History of Web Scraping:
  * The World Wide Web was implemented in 1989, 4 years later the World Wide Web Wanderer was created only to measure the size of the web.
  * The first crawler-based web search engine was launched in 1993 as JumpStation
  * In 2000, the first Web API and API crawler came. In the same year, Salesforce and eBay launch their own API.


### [How to scrape websites without getting blocked](https://www.scrapehero.com/how-to-prevent-getting-blacklisted-while-scraping/)
- Web scraping is a tasks that needs to be done correctly and carefully or you may cause detrimental effects on the site that's being scraped.
- > While most websites may not have anti-scraping mechanisms, some sites use measures that can lead to web scraping getting blocked, because they do not believe in open data access.
- > If a crawler performs multiple requests per second and downloads large files, an under-powered server would have a hard time keeping up with requests from multiple crawlers. Since web crawlers, scrapers or spiders (words used interchangeably) don’t really drive human website traffic and seemingly affect the performance of the site, some site administrators do not like spiders and try to block their access.
- Tips for web scraping:
  * Make the crawling slower, do not slam the server, treat websites nicely
  * Do not follow the same crawling pattern
  * Make requests through Proxies and rotate them as needed
  * Rotate User Agents and corresponding HTTP Request Headers between requests
  * Use a headless browser like Puppeteer, Selenium or Playwright
  * Beware of Honey Pot Traps
  * Check if Website is Changing Layouts
  * Avoid scraping data behind a login
  * Use Captcha Solving Services
- How can websites detect and block web scraping?
  1. Unusual traffic/high download rate
  2. Repetitive tasks performed on the website in the same browsing pattern
  3. Checking if you are real browser
  4. Detection through honeypots
