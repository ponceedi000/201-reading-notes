  * The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
- If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?
  * You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces {}.
- Each list item needs a unique ____.
  * key
- What is the purpose of a key?
  * > Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity:

### [The Spread Operator](https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab)
- What is the spread operator?
  * > InJavaScript, spread syntax refers to the use of an ellipsis of three dots (â€¦) to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.

  *  `const a = ['to', 'code'];
const b = ['learning', ...a, 'is', 'fun']; 
console.log(b); //> ['learning', 'to', 'code', 'is', 'fun']`
- Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.
  *  `let numberStore = [0, 1, 2];
let newNumber = 12;
numberStore = [...numberStore, newNumber];`

  *  `let person = {
    firstName: 'John',
