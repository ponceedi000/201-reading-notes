## Readings: React and Forms
***
### [React Docs - Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)
- What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
  * > An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.
- Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
  * To my understanding, with `handleChange`, it'll run every keystroke to update the React state. The display value will update as the user types. With a controolled Component, the input's value is always driven by the React state.
- How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
  * > It can sometimes be tedious to use controlled components, because you need to write an event handler for every way your data can change and pipe all of the input state through a React component.
  * In some cases, you may want to utilize **uncontrolled components**.

### [The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained](https://codeburst.io/javascript-the-conditional-ternary-operator-explained-cac7218beeff)
- Why would we use a ternary operator?
  * It's a shorthand method of writing an if statement. Saves lines of code and has the same outcome as an original if statement
- Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
  *   `if(x===y){
 console.log(true);
  } else {
 console.log(false);
  }`
  * `x === y ? true : false`
