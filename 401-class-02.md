### [In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python](https://code.likeagirl.io/in-tests-we-trust-tdd-with-python-af69f47e6932)

- What are unit test and TDD?
  * > "Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.
But Test-Driven Development is a strategy to think (and write!) tests first."
- AAA: Arrange, Act and Assert
  * ***Arrange:*** you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input);
  * ***Act:*** here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour);
  * ***Assert:*** after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.
- TDD Cycle: This cycle has three steps
   * Write a unit test and make it fail (it needs to fail because the feature isn’t there, right? If this test passes, call the Ghostbusters, really)
   * Write the feature and make the test pass! (you can dance after that)
   *  Refactor the code — the first version doesn’t need to be the beautiful one (don’t be shy)
 - ***Summary***
   * What's most advantageous about TDD is that you can craft software design first
   * More reliable code after proper testing
   * THe beginning of testing may be hard at first but that's normal. Practice makes perfect

### [If name equals main](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-does-the-if-__name__-__main__-do/)

- What does the if __name__ == “__main__”: do?
  * > "Before executing code, Python interpreter reads source file and define few special variables/global variables. 
If the python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special __name__ variable to have a value “__main__”. If this file is being imported from another module, __name__ will be set to the module’s name. Module’s name is available as value to __name__ global variable."
  * Example:  
```
# Python program to use
# main for function call.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_function()
 
import myscript
 
myscript.my_function()
```
- Advantages:
  * > Every Python module has it’s __name__ defined and if this is ‘__main__’, it implies that the module is being run standalone by the user and we can do corresponding appropriate actions.
  * > If you import this script as a module in another script, the __name__ is set to the name of the script/module.
  * > Python files can act as either reusable modules, or as standalone programs.
  * > if __name__ == “main”: is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported.

### [Recursion](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursion/)

- What is Recursion? 
  * > The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.
