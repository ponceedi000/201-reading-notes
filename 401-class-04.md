### [Classes and Objects](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects)
- Ehat are classes and Objects?
  * > "Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects."
  * EX:
```
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")
```
- Accessing Object Variables
  * If you want to access a variable inside of your new object, you would do the following:
```
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

myobjectx.variable
```
- Accessing Object Functions
  * Similar to accessing a variable within an object:
```
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

myobjectx.function()
```
- init()
  * > "The `__init__()` function, is a special function that is called when the class is being initiated. It's used for asigning values in a class.
