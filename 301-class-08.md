## Readings: APIs
***
### [API Design Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design)
- What does REST stand for?
  * Representational state transfer
- REST APIs are designed around  ____.
  * > REST APIs are designed around resources, which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client.
- What is an identifer of a resource? Give an example
  * A resource has an identifier, which is a URI that uniquely identifies that resource. For example, the URI for a particular customer order might be:
    * https://adventure-works.com/orders/1
- What are the most common HTTP verbs?
  * GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
- What should the URIs be based on?
  * Resource URIs should be based on nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource).
-Give an example of a good URI.
  * https://adventure-works.com/orders // Good
  * https://adventure-works.com/create-order // Avoid
- What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?
  * Bad, you want to avoid chatty web APIs that expose a large number of small resources
- What status code does a successful GET request return?
  * HTTP status code 200 (OK) 
- What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?
  * if the resource cannot be found, the method should return 404 (Not Found).
- What status code does a successful POST request return?
  * If a POST method creates a new resource, it returns HTTP status code 201 (Created). 
- What status code does a successful DELETE request return?
  * HTTP status code 204 (No Content)
  

## Things I want to know more about
- URI and URL, how are they related to each other?
