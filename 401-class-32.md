### [DRF Permissions](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/)

- What are permissions?
  * > Authentication or identification by itself is not usually sufficient to gain access to information or code. For that, the entity requesting access must have authorization. — [Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/security/Conceptual/AuthenticationAndAuthorizationGuide/Authorization/Authorization.html)

- How permissions are determined:
  * > Permissions in REST framework are always defined as a list of permission classes.
  * If any permissions checks fail, you will likely get the following exceptions:
    * `exceptions.PermissionDenied` or `exceptions.NotAuthenticated`
  * When the permission checks fail, you either get a "403 Forbidden" or a "401 Unauthorized" response. This is according to the following rules:
    * The request was successfully authenticated, but permission was denied. — An HTTP 403 Forbidden response will be returned.
    * The request was not successfully authenticated, and the highest priority authentication class does not use `WWW-Authenticate` headers. — An HTTP 403 Forbidden response will be returned.
    * The request was not successfully authenticated, and the highest priority authentication class does use `WWW-Authenticate` headers. — An HTTP 401 Unauthorized response, with an appropriate `WWW-Authenticate` header will be returned.

- Object level permissions
  * "Object level permissions are used to determine if a user should be allowed to act on a particular object, which will typically be a model instance."
  * REST frameworks permissions fact: It supports object-level permissioning
  * Important Note: "Object level permissions are run by REST framework's generic views when .get_object() is called."
EX:
```
def get_object(self):
    obj = get_object_or_404(self.get_queryset(), pk=self.kwargs["pk"])
    self.check_object_permissions(self.request, obj)
    return obj
```

- Setting the permission policy **globally**
```
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',
    ]
}
```
- Setting the permission policy, **allowing unrestricted access:**
```
'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
   'rest_framework.permissions.AllowAny',
]
```
- You can also set the authentication policy on a per-view, or per-viewset basis, using the APIView class-based views
```
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.views import APIView

class ExampleView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]

    def get(self, request, format=None):
        content = {
            'status': 'request was permitted'
        }
        return Response(content)
```

- API Reference
  * The `AllowAny` permission class will allow unrestricted access, regardless of if the request was authenticated or unauthenticated.
  * The `IsAuthenticated` permission class will deny permission to any unauthenticated user, and allow permission otherwise.
  * The `IsAdminUser` permission class will deny permission to any user, unless user.is_staff is True in which case permission will be allowed.
  * The `IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly` will allow authenticated users to perform any request. Requests for unauthorised users will only be permitted if the request method is one of the "safe" methods; `GET`, `HEAD` or `OPTIONS`.

### [DRF Generic Views](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/generic-views/)
- > Django’s generic views... were developed as a shortcut for common usage patterns... They take certain common idioms and patterns found in view development and abstract them so that you can quickly write common views of data without having to repeat yourself. — [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/class-based-views/#base-vs-generic-views)

- Typically when using the generic views, you'll override the view, and set several class attributes.
EX:
```
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from myapp.serializers import UserSerializer
from rest_framework import generics
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAdminUser

class UserList(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    queryset = User.objects.all()
    serializer_class = UserSerializer
    permission_classes = [IsAdminUser]
```
