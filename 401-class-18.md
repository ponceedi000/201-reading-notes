- > One of the earliest encryption techniques is the Caesar Cipher, invented by Julius Caesar more than two thousand years ago to communicate messages to his allies.
- > The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher which replaces each original letter with a different letter in the alphabet by shifting the alphabet by a certain amount.
- EX: SECRET MEETING AT THE PALACE
- EX (encrypted - shifted 6): YKIXKZ SKKZOTM GZ ZNK VGRGIK
- > According to historical records, Caesar always used a shift of 3. As long as his message recipient knew the shift amount, it was trivial for them to decode the message.
- > Another term for the original unencrypted message is plaintext. If the enemy already knew some part of the plaintext, it will be easier for them to crack the rest of the encrypted version.
- Key aspects of of data encryption:
  * Encryption: scrambling the data according to a secret key (in this case, the alphabet shift).
  * Decryption: recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key.
  * Code cracking: uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques.

- What is cryptography?
  * > Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes, so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it.
- What is Caeser Cipher?
  * > It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
