### [The Past, Present & Future of Local Storage for Web Applications](http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/storage.html) - Written by Mark Pilgrim
- > Cookies were invented early in the web's history and they can be used as persistent local storage of small amounts of data. But they have three potentially dealbreaking downsides:
- Cookies are included every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over

- Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data - enough to slow down your application, but not enough to be terribly useful
