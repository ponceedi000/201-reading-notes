### [Whiteboard Advice](https://hackernoon.com/the-best-whiteboard-interview-advice-i-ever-received-3ebbfa72e4a)

- Communicate:
  * Once the interview has officially started, the interview will state the problem domain. It's important to restate the question back.
- ASk about Edge Cases
  * Think a bit about the inputs and desired output and what edge cases could potentially be involved.
  * EX: "Now that I confirmed my understanding of the problem, I’d like to ask about some potential edge cases. Is it possible that the input would be a type other than a number? If so, what should the function do? Can the input be 0 or negative? Again, if so, what should the function do?"
- Ask about Test Cases:
  * Be sure to ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass.
  * The interview may be expecting you to ask this.
- Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense:
  * > "If your pseudocode looks good but you end up having difficulty translating it to actual code, you have actually earned a lot of points by now!"
- Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good:
  * Start converting your pseudocode into actual code. 
  * If you forget some syntax or a method name, you should be able to ask your interview for this info. Don't worry to much about having to ask.
- Stuck? Ask for Help!:
  * A good way to ask for help example: "I’m a bit stuck here, do you have any tips to nudge me in the right direction?"
  * His or her response might be that the anser is "no, I'd like to see if you can solve it on your own" or you can possible expect to be given a useful tip!

### [6 Tips](https://blog.usejournal.com/6-tips-to-ace-a-whiteboard-programming-interview-f06c1b378bc6)

- Take a few minutes
  * Don't waste precious time trying to fill the silence by saying everything you're thinking about while also simultaneously trying to solve the problem in your head.
  * Good example of how to take a moment to think: "Okay, got it. If it’s okay with you, I’m just going to take a minute or two here and think about the problem, and then I’ll start talking."
- Write down the steps of the solution. 
  * After you come up with an idea for solving the problem, don't jump straight to code. Take the time to walk through the genral steps and how you plan to solve it.
- Write pseudocode first.
  * > Often we run into problems halfway through writing the code, and there’s no point wasting time over syntax when you might have to throw the code away. Instead, write some half-baked code-looking stuff that lays out the structure of how your code will work.
- Don’t sweat the small stuff:
  * Interviews are all about demonstrating depth and breadth of knowledge, personality strengths, and probelm solving. If you make a mistake, brush it off and push foward.
- Sit down. Be humble:Some key things interviewrs are looking for:
  * Are you able to express your ideas and solutions clearly and effectively?
  * Do you treat the interviewer with respect?
  * How do you accept criticism (technical, constructive or otherwise)?
  * Are you able to collaborate with others to come up with solutions?
  * Do you communicate in a way that demonstrates empathy?
  * Are you honest (especially about yourself)?
- Come prepared:
  * Knowing that you’ve done all you can to prepare for the interview helps you stay calm and cool, and increases your ultimate chances of success.
- Review your work:
  * Algorithmic efficiency. Have you found the fastest and most optimal solution given the requirements?
  * Correctness. Sure, you’ve solved for the simple, easy use case, but have you checked for edge cases? Off-by-one errors?
