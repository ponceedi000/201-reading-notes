### [Whiteboard Advice](https://hackernoon.com/the-best-whiteboard-interview-advice-i-ever-received-3ebbfa72e4a)

- Communicate:
  * Once the interview has officially started, the interview will state the problem domain. It's important to restate the question back.
- ASk about Edge Cases
  * Think a bit about the inputs and desired output and what edge cases could potentially be involved.
  * EX: "Now that I confirmed my understanding of the problem, I’d like to ask about some potential edge cases. Is it possible that the input would be a type other than a number? If so, what should the function do? Can the input be 0 or negative? Again, if so, what should the function do?"
- Ask about Test Cases:
  * Be sure to ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass.
  * The interview may be expecting you to ask this.
- Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense:
  * > "If your pseudocode looks good but you end up having difficulty translating it to actual code, you have actually earned a lot of points by now!"
- Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good:
  * Start converting your pseudocode into actual code. 
  * If you forget some syntax or a method name, you should be able to ask your interview for this info. Don't worry to much about having to ask.
- Stuck? Ask for Help!:
  * A good way to ask for help example: "I’m a bit stuck here, do you have any tips to nudge me in the right direction?"
  * His or her response might be that the anser is "no, I'd like to see if you can solve it on your own" or you can possible expect to be given a useful tip!

1. Take a few minutes
  * Don't waste precious time trying to fill the silence by saying everything you're thinking about while also simultaneously trying to solve the problem in your head.
  * Good example of how to take a moment to think: "Okay, got it. If it’s okay with you, I’m just going to take a minute or two here and think about the problem, and then I’ll start talking."
2. Write down the steps of the solution.
