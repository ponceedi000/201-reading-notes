### [What is Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html)
- > JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.
- You can have multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splitters built into the software.
- > Code Consoles provide transient scratchpads for running code interactively, with full support for rich output. A code console can be linked to a notebook kernel as a computation log from the notebook, for example.
- > Kernel-backed documents enable code in any text file (Markdown, Python, R, LaTeX, etc.) to be run interactively in any Jupyter kernel.
- > Notebook cell outputs can be mirrored into their own tab, side by side with the notebook, enabling simple dashboards with interactive controls backed by a kernel.
- > Multiple views of documents with different editors or viewers enable live editing of documents reflected in other viewers. For example, it is easy to have live preview of Markdown, Delimiter-separated Values, or Vega/Vega-Lite documents.
- JupyterLab also understands and handles images, CSV, JSON, MD, PDF, Vega, Vega-Lite, etc...
### [NumPy Tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/numpy-tutorial-python/)

- What is NumPy?
  * NumPy is a Python data analysis package which is commonly used. 
- Why use it?
  * > By using NumPy, you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem, like scikit-learn, that use NumPy under the hood.
